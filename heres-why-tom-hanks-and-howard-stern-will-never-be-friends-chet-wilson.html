As a result, it makes perfect sense that most of the celebrities that wound up in Stern’s crosshairs at that time didn’t like him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More recently, Howard Stern has clearly undergone a transformation as he is now more interested in having deep conversations than saying something shocking. In fact, a lot of people consider Stern to be among the best interviewers in the business which explains why he now has a long list of celebrity friends.</p><p>If you are looking for the perfect example of how Howard Stern has changed over the years, look at his relationship with Adam Sandler. After all, <a href=#>Stern and Sandler recently made amends</a> after years of hard feelings based on Howard’s previous antics. While Sandler and Stern have made up, there is a very good reason why it seems likely that Howard and Tom Hanks will never be pals.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Howard Stern And Jimmy Kimmel's Friendship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=howard-finds-a-target>Howard Finds A Target</h2><p>Throughout Tom Hanks’ legendary career, he has come to be known as one of the most universally respected and beloved actors in Hollywood history. Since he seems like such a likable fellow, the idea that <a href=#>a celebrity may dislike Hanks</a> seems pretty shocking. However, since the hard feelings that must exist between Tom and Howard Stern aren’t related to anything specific the megastar actor did, they are a lot less surprising.</p><p>Even though Howard Stern is a lot kinder when he talks about most celebrities these days, that doesn’t mean that he has lost the sharp tongue that made him a legend to being with. Unfortunately for Tom Hanks’ son Chet, he has been the target of some pretty harsh words from Stern.</p><p>In the past, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Stern called out Chet Haze</a> whenever Tom Hanks’ son was brought up. While talking to Shade 45’s Rude Jude in March 2015, Stern stated that Chet was “stealing your black culture” which was a pretty tame statement for Howard. However, when Stern has also harshly insulted Chet considering that he called Tom Hanks’ son a “f**kin’ d**che” in February 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering that Chet Hanks has done many ridiculous things, some people have been left wondering about <a href=#>how close Chet's relationship with his parents is</a>. However, from all accounts, Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks unreservedly love Chet. With that in mind, it should go without saying that Tom wouldn’t want to hang out with someone who has repeatedly taken shots as his son the way Howard Stern has.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Can't Believe Chet Hanks Is 'Forrest Gump's' Son After White Boy Summer Vid</a></span></p><h2 id=chet-takes-things-way-too-far>Chet Takes Things Way Too Far</h2><p>Even though Chet Haze’s father is a Hollywood heavyweight, the young rapper has never been afraid to say anything. For proof of that, all you have to do is look at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the extreme way Chet responded after Howard Stern called him out</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Howard Stern severely insulted Chet Haze, that didn’t make it ok for the rapper to threaten the radio legend with violence. Despite that, in 2015 Haze challenged Stern to a fight in a since-deleted tweet. "Let me come up on your show b*tch," he wrote. "Come catch this fade ... have me live on the air and we can go pound for pound see who looks like the fool you dried up old c**t ... easy to talk sh*t in a closed off room p**sy, have me up there in the studio with you let's give the ppl what they want."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Howard Stern's Old Fanbase Turned On Him</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If that wasn’t bad enough, Chet then escalated things by threatening to outright attack Stern if he gets the chance to. "Do you have any idea how badly I am going to assault you when I see you… You can't run from me forever knock knees… Listen. One day, maybe tomorrow, maybe 10 years from now, I am going to see you in person, and I am going to hurt you." "I hope you travel with security!!! PLEASE have me on the show… I'll sh*t on you and your yuppie sidekicks on your own show… it’s a shame you don’t hang in the same circles as my family (not enough bread for that) cuz if you did I woulda already seen u."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Evidently aware that his tweets would garner a lot of attention and reflect poorly on his celebrity parents, Chet Haze went on to address those facts in a pair of tweets. "I AM A WALKING PR DISASTER AND I COULD LITERALLY GIVE A F**K LESS!!!!!" he wrote. "OH WAIT I MEANT I LITERALLY (sic) DON'T GIVE A SINGLE F**K!!!!" "I DON'T LIVE MY LIFE BY ANYBODY'S RULES BUT MY OWN... SUCK MY F**KING D**K!!!! LMAOOOO!!!!! Ultimately, Chet’s claims about not caring about any backlash to his tweets were undermined by the fact that he quickly deleted them.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Rolling Stone Says This Massive Movie Star Is The Worst SNL Cast Member Ever</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmq6ilXZ2ur7fSZpinnF2dvLit0Z1krKyVp7tuw8ilo2amlauys3nBnmSfqpmau6W%2FjJyfnqxdrLatv86nZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./charlie-wilson-npr-tiny-desk-black-music-month-1234762187.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charlie Wilson Hits NPR's Tiny Desk For Black Music Month">&larr;
