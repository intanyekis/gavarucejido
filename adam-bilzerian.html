In addition to that, he is also a writer and has some books to his name.</p><p>Bilzerian was born in 1983 to corporate takeover specialist father <a href=#><strong>Paul Bilzerian</strong></a> and mother, <strong>Terri Bilzerian</strong>. Similarly, Bilzerian holds an American nationality and belongs to the white ethnic race.</p><h2>Adam Bilzerian Personal Life</h2><p>He belongs to one of the wealthiest families of Florida. But, he had to live without his father during most of his childhood. While he was at school, his father was imprisoned and could not attend Adams' high school graduation ceremony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/2/Webp.net-resizeimage-1577954216475.jpg><p>Similarly, his father's ill-treatment by the country brought a big disappointment toward the U.S. from Adam. After that, he moved from the U.S to Saint Kitts and Navis in 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>Adam further lives along with his wife and two children in the million-dollar mansion that he bought in Saint Kitts and Nevis. His father joined him after releasing from the prison. Unlike his quiet lifestyle, his elder brother Dan lives an affluent life partying and having fun.&nbsp;</p><p>Brother Dan also holds dual nationality, including an Armenia citizenship. Moreover, he has a lot of dating records akin to <a href=#><strong>Hugh Hefner</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Adam Bilzerian Net Worth</h2><p>Bilzerian comes from a wealthy lifestyle; his father was a self-made millionaire who had a net worth of over <strong>$81.4 million</strong>. Luckily, he funneled his fortune to his sons just before his legal battle.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/2/16034486766_30a3394555_z-1577954457956.jpg><p>Paul had a big support towards his children's financial status. Similarly, Adam's brother, Dan, has a fortune of <strong>$200 million</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, Adam invested <strong>$400,000</strong> for the hotel giant 'Marriott.' Similarly, he has ventured in much other business but has not disclosed his total wealth.</p><h2>Who is Adam Bilzerian?</h2><p>He is an American born poker player and writer. Bilzerian further moved to Saint Kitts and Navis after the ill-treatment of his father by the US government. Adam grew up with his brother and previously had the ambition to be an army man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/7/15/Adam_family-1563177701081.jpg><p>Bilzerian, moreover, grew up in Florida and attended Gaither High School. Later, he went on to study at Vanderbilt University. He played tennis in his college days and wanted to enlist in the US Army.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, things did not turn out like he wanted, when his father was arrested in charge of fraudulent market manipulation. This dropped his dream of enlisting in the army.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, Adam turned into poker and participated in the '<i>World Series of Poker</i>' where he ended up reaching the 47th rank. He also received <strong>$138,568</strong> as prize money from the game. Likewise, his elder brother Dan Bilzerian also took part in the tournament.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/2/58f38049d3904337188b4579-1577955310765.jpg><p>Sportswriter <strong>Norman Chad</strong> referred the brothers as "Flying Bilzerian Brothers" for their excellent performance. However, Adam left the US for his resentment against the American Lawmakers. Besides, he also wrote a book "<i>America: Love it or Leave it-So I Left</i>" which costs around <strong>$18 </strong>in Hardcover.</p><p><i><strong>For more updates, Subscribe to Married Celeb!!!</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jpqbmqVdl7atxsSroJqm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./zoe-laverne-homophobic-slurs-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zoe Laverne Admits to Using Homophobic and Transphobic Slurs">&larr;
