That’s what makes it even more shocking when famous couples that have been together forever announced they’re breaking up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The world was shocked when Sylvester Stallone’s wife <a href=#>Jennifer Flavin filed for divorce</a> in August following 25-years of marriage. The break-up seemed less than amicable, given the accusations the model was levying at her estranged husband. However, it was even more surprising when the couple reconciled in the middle of all the drama.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Reasons Ellen DeGeneres Is Officially Canceled</a></span></p><p>This begs the question of why Sylvester and Jennifer got back together in the first place. Here’s everything we know about their reunion.</p><h2 id=sylvester-stallone-and-jennifer-flavin-were-originally-fighting-over-money>Sylvester Stallone And Jennifer Flavin Were Originally Fighting Over Money</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On August 19, Jennifer filed for divorce in Florida. Court documents reveal she accused him of "[engaging] <a href=#>in the intentional dissipation</a>, depletion and/or waste of marital assets, which has had an adverse economic impact on the marital estate." Under Florida law, a spouse usually cites this ass a divorce reason if the other partner has excessively borrowed or spent money.</p><p>Jennifer further requested “unequal distribution of the marital assets in her favor." Her lawyers argued "the Husband should be enjoined from, selling, transferring, assigning, encumbering, or dissipating any assets during the pendency of these proceedings."</p><p>Sylvester’s legal team later responded to Jennifer’s filing by denying that the actor had misappropriated their marital assets.</p><p>" <a href=#>The husband has not engaged</a> in any conduct which constitutes intentional dissipation, depletion and/or waste of marital assets," court documents filed by his attorneys revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sylvester also later emphasized to the media that their relationship as over, calling thins “irretrievably broken” between them.</p><h2 id=stallone-and-flavin-called-off-the-divorce-but-things-remain-rocky>Stallone And Flavin Called Off The Divorce, But Things Remain Rocky</h2><p>Even though things seemed to be getting messy in their divorce, Sylvester and Jennifer surprised fans by revealing they’d reconciled in September. A spokesperson for the pair confirmed the news. “<a href=#>They decided to meet back</a> up at home, where they talked and were able to work out their differences,” the rep said.</p><p>They’ve also submitted an order of abatement to put the divorce on hold as they work things through.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The long-time couple didn’t give a reason for their reconciliation, but it can be assumed they’re working through whatever initially prompted Jennifer to file for divorce. However, even though they’re back together, sources warn that it’s not smooth sailing between Sylvester and Jennifer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Khloe Kardashian Really Feels About Tristan Thompson Rejecting His Son With Maralee Nichols</a></span></p><p>One source implied that a major reason for reconciliation was how difficult it would be to divide their millions amid a divorce. "They have $their differences, but in a long-term marriage like theirs, ending it and dividing up their assets would be difficult," the insider told <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>.</p><p>The source said that while they currently have a “better channel of communication,” it’s not all “bliss” between the couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During their divorce, it was reported that Sylvester and Jennifer didn’t have a prenup. With a decades-long movie career, Sylvester is <a href=#>worth a reported $400 million</a>. While Jennifer started out in modelling, she’s since started her own business, and is worth $50 million in her own right.</p><p>With no prenup in place, it seems likely that Sylvester would’ve had to pay a large sum to his wife in the case of divorce, considering how long they’ve been together. This would be especially true if Jennifer’s accusations were found to be true, and he request to unequally divide the assets upheld by the court.</p><p>So, while Sylvester Jenifer’s reconciliation may be motivated by mutual affection, it may also be partly due to a desire to avoid a messy (and highly publicized) divorce.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Leonardo DiCaprio And Gigi Hadid’s Relationship A PR Stunt?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stallone-and-flavin-have-been-through-many-scandals-during-their-25-years-together>Stallone And Flavin Have Been Through Many Scandals During Their 25 Years Together</h2><p>Even though Sylvester and Jennifer’s relationship may still be rocky (pun intended), they’ve weathered difficult times before, especially before they were married. But they’ve always found a way back to each other, and this time seems to be no different from the past.</p><p><a href=#>The pair reportedly met in 1988</a> when Jennifer was only 19 years old, while Sylvester was already in his 40s. They dated on-and-off for multiple years, but scandal struck the couple in 1994 when it was revealed supermodel Janice Dickinson had conceived a child with Sylvester while he was in a relationship with Jennifer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sylvester and Jennifer subsequently broke up, and the First Blood actor attempted a relationship with Janice. However, he later learned that the model’s daughter was not his, leading Sylvester and Janice to break up for good. By 1995, Sylvester and Jennifer were back together. They welcomed their daughter the following year, and officially tied the knot in 1997 before welcoming two more girls.</p><p>While infidelity would be the end of many people’s relationships, Jennifer has opened up about why she took the actor back, emphasizing their long history.</p><p>" <a href=#>I was disappointed</a> ," she said. "You can't just write somebody off in a letter after six years. It's not like I was going to try to beg him to come back to me or anything. I just wanted to talk."</p><p>Six years pales in comparison to the twenty-five years the couple now has behind them. Considering Jennifer was willing to take Sylvester back after his affair with Janice, it makes it less surprising the couple worked things out recently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbaledKyo6%2Bdo6mys3nSrZilpJ%2Bjsm62xKelop6Vp3qnuMCvoKdll5rBbq7AnKJmrJ%2BcsrW0xKtm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./friends-fans-just-found-out-why-the-chemistry-between-ross-and-rachel-felt-so-real.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Friends' Fans Just Found Out Why The Chemistry Between Ross And Rachel Felt So Real">&larr;
