The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two gained worldwide notoriety for their roles in the films</a> and skyrocketed to international stardom, however, their performance in the film was not the only reason they were the talk of the town.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After wrapping up filming on the first film in 2007, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shia LaBeouf</a> later went on to make several statements that he and Megan Fox shared a romantic relationship during their time working together. Although Megan herself did not comment on the matter, things became clear after it was also revealed that Shia had attacked someone for being rude to Megan.</p><p>After all these years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Megan Fox</a> finally revealed in 2018 that she and Shia did, in fact, share a romantic relationship, but things were definitely more complicated than the two led on. From working together, to drunken Facetime calls, these two have been through it all. Here is everything we know about Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox's friendship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-met-on-set-of-transformers><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>They Met On Set Of "Transformers"</span></h2><p>Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox first met on the set of their hit film "Transformers", which was released over 13 years ago in 2007. Despite the two being in the same age bracket and having worked in the industry since they were teenagers, it's odd to think they've never crossed paths before. According to both stars, the chemistry was instant and clearly made for what eventually turned into a hit film series.</p><h2 id=shia-claimed-they-had-a-romantic-relationship><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Shia Claimed They Had A Romantic Relationship</span></h2><p>After having worked together on a film and spending over half a year acting together, Shia LaBeouf revealed back in 2008 that he and Megan Fox had a romantic relationship. The actor claimed that working together for such a long time led the two to develop feelings for one another and ultimately led to a brief romantic relationship, the only problem is, Megan had begun dating actor Brian Austin Green at the time, which led to quite the media frenzy.</p><h2 id=but-megan-fox-hadn-t-confirmed-said-rumours><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>But Megan Fox Hadn't Confirmed Said Rumours</span></h2><p>Despite Shia LaBeouf coming forward claiming that he and Megan Fox shared a romantic relationship during the filming of the first "Transformers" film, Megan Fox remained silent on the matter. When asked about their relationship, Megan refrained from confirming or denying the rumours and although she did not necessarily claim that their romance never happened, her silence led fans and viewers of the film franchise to believe Shia had lied.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shia-attacked-a-taco-bell-cashier-to-defend-megan-s-honour><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Shia&nbsp;Attacked A Taco Bell Cashier To Defend Megan's Honour</span></h2><p>In addition to claiming the two had slept together, Shia LaBeouf appeared to have been telling the truth after he attacked a Taco Bell cashier who was allegedly being rude to Megan Fox. According to an interview LaBeouf had with Details&nbsp;back in 2011,&nbsp;it was revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he had hopped over the cash register and began whaling on the worker </a>in defence of Megan Fox. While this is a great gesture, it appears to be one that is reserved for people who are definitely romantically involved, making the rumours appear to be true.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Surprising Things Shia LaBeouf Is Up To Now</a></span></p><h2 id=after-7-years-megan-fox-confirmed-the-rumours><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>After 7 Years, Megan Fox Confirmed The Rumours</span></h2><p>Despite remaining silent on the matter for so long, Megan Fox finally let the cat out of the bag! During her 2018 visit to the "Watch What Happens Live!" clubhouse with host Andy Cohen, Megan Fox played a round of "Plead The Fifth" where she was asked to clear up Shia's statement regarding the two's relationship. It was at this moment that Megan confirmed that the two were romantic with one another during the filming of the movie and that she had never actually denied the rumours, but simply never officially confirmed them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-two-s-showmance-ended-after-the-final-film><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Two's Showmance Ended After The Final Film</span></h2><p>Although the two made quite the fitting couple, it appears it was only a match made in heaven while they were on the job! During her "Watch What Happens Live!" interview, Megan Fox confirmed her romantic relationship with Shia LaBeouf, however, she made it clear that the two were only involved with one another during the filming of the movie. Host, Andy Cohen, asked if the relationship continued once filming wrapped, and Fox made it evident that they were not together afterwards.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Facts Fan Forget About Megan Fox</a></span></p><h2 id=both-shia-amp-megan-went-on-to-get-married><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Both Shia & Megan Went On To Get Married</span></h2><p>Despite fans and viewers of the hit film "Transformers" loving the two together, it appears they were not meant to be. Actress Megan Fox would later go on to marry her longtime boyfriend, Brian Austin Green in 2010, and Shia LaBeouf had himself a Las Vegas wedding to girlfriend, Mia Goth. Although they both found love with other people, Shia and Mia later separated as is Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green, who announced their separation this past week after a decade of marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=megan-posted-a-throwback-moment-of-shia-on-instagram><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Megan Posted A Throwback Moment Of Shia On Instagram</span></h2><p>Prior to announcing her separation to Brian Austin Green, for the second time, it appears Megan Fox took a stroll down memory lane this very time last year. The actress took to her Instagram to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> post this funny shot of Shia LaBeouf imitating one of Megan's most notorious scenes </a>in the "Transformers" franchise. Fox captioned the shot saying "once upon a time 13 years ago". While we aren't sure if she was simply reminiscing over good times or if the post was hinting at something more, either way, we couldn't get enough of it.</p><h2 id=the-two-still-remain-in-touch-via-facetime><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Two Still Remain In Touch Via FaceTime</span></h2><p>Despite having moved on from their brief romantic stint in the late 2000s, both Megan Fox and Shia LaBeouf remain in contact to this very day. During Fox's interview on "WWHL", she told host Andy Cohen that she will "always love him", leading fans to believe that there is still something going on. Additionally, Shia was photographed drunkenly Facetiming Megan Fox back in 2015 while he was having a public heated exchange with girlfriend, Mia Goth. The entire event was filmed by paparazzi and certainly increased the rumours between the two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shia LaBeouf & His Ex Were Spotted Together...Wearing Rings!</a></span></p><h2 id=shia-is-said-to-be-a-factor-in-fox-s-split-from-husband><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Shia Is Said To Be A Factor In Fox's Split From Husband</span></h2><p>Although Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green made for quite the stunning couple, it appears they have far too many cracks in the foundation of their marriage. The duo shares three children with one another and will continue to co-parent once their divorce is finalized. Despite sharing a decade of marriage together, it appears as if things took a toll and have finally come to a head. According to a number of sources, Brian Austin Green has had issues with Megan and Shia's relationship, which is reportedly a contributing factor to the two officially splitting up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-two-have-since-left-hollywood-behind><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Two Have Since Left Hollywood Behind</span></h2><p>Both Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox were the "it" actors throughout the 2000s. After appearing it in shows on Disney, FOX, ABC and appearing in countless blockbuster films, it appears as if they have taken a step back from acting. Shia LaBeouf definitely felt the need to express his disdain for Hollywood after appearing on the red carpet at the 2014 Berlin Film Festival with a paper bag over his head claiming he is "not famous anymore". Despite both actors taking a break from the limelight, it appears we should be seeing more of the two as they have both separately mentioned they are looking to take on more roles now.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shia LaBeouf Is References As His Generations Greatest Actor</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiknp%2BRo3qnu9dmmKecXai1qq2MpZibnZ%2Bqs26y0aKcp5yjnbaxedOrmKerlqS%2FrrHRrGSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./best-states-to-buy-a-rental-property.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 Best States to Buy a Rental Property in 2024">&larr;
