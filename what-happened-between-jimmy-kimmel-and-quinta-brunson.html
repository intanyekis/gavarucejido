Back in those days, her main platform was social media, where she would post various comedic videos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brunson graduated to produce content for BuzzFeed Video, before she eventually landed an acting role in one episode of the sitcom New Girl on Fox in 2018. Her first main acting gig was in HBO’s A Black Lady Sketch Show, where she featured in various roles between 2019 and 2022.</p><p>On Tuesday night, Brunson was crowned the winner of a Primetime Emmy Award for “Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series.” This was for her <a href=#>hit mockumentary sitcom Abbott Elementary</a> on ABC. The 32-year-old also stars in the show, alongside <a href=#>Sheryl Lee Ralph</a> (Dreamgirls), Janelle James (The Final Straw) and Tyler James Williams (Everybody Hates Chris).</p><p>Brunson was nominated in three categories at the 2022 Emmys overall, losing out on the gongs for “Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series” and “Outstanding Comedy Series.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 TV Shows With The Most Emmy Nominations Of All Time</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brunson’s moment was distracted by presenter Jimmy Kimmel, who has now found himself in hot water with fans for his antics.</p><h2 id=jimmy-kimmel-was-one-of-the-presenters-for-quinta-brunson-rsquo-s-winning-category-at-the-emmys>Jimmy Kimmel Was One Of The Presenters For Quinta Brunson’s Winning Category At The Emmys</h2><p>The category “Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series” at the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards was going to be presented by late night show host Jimmy Kimmel, and actor, comedian and producer Will Arnett.</p><p>When the pair were called on stage to do the honors, Arnett came in dragging his partner’s seemingly lifeless body. This was practically an ode to the Canadian’s <a href=#>half-improvised murder mystery drama series Murderville</a> on <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the show, Arnett’s character Terry Seattle guides a guest star each episode through a fictional murder puzzle that they need to solve. The semi-scripted nature of the series often leads to various character breaking moments, including one where a ‘corpse’ burst out laughing in an episode featuring Kumail Nanjiani.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is Why Fans Think Will Arnett's Career Has Peaked</a></span></p><p>Kimmel and Arnett’s act looked very much like a scene from Murderville, with the host of Jimmy Kimmel Live! remaining motionless as his colleague read out the winner. “Jimmy couldn’t be here tonight,” Arnett joked, before going on to announce Brunson as the winner in the category.</p><h2 id=what-did-jimmy-kimmel-do-during-quinta-brunson-rsquo-s-emmy-speech>What Did Jimmy Kimmel Do During Quinta Brunson’s Emmy Speech?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Will Arnett had handed over the award to Quinta Brunson and she stepped up to give her winning speech, Jimmy Kimmel continued to lie on the floor without moving. The actress – who was not in on the act – literally had to step over him in order to get to the microphone.</p><p>“Jimmy, wake up I won!… Jimmy?” Brunson beckoned the comedian. Kimmel only gave a thumbs up signal back, and she was forced to go on with her speech while he remained frozen at her feet. The multi-talented Philadelphian managed to go through it without getting further distracted, but the general public picked on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kimmel’s deed as being disrespectful</a>.</p><p>“Jimmy needed to get up, that was beyond disrespectful of him to stay there to maintain a bit he did to joke about not winning,” one observer commented on YouTube. This reference was about a quip that Arnett made regarding Kimmel’s own losing streak at the Emmys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel May Have Gone Too Far With This One</a></span></p><p>“Hate that this dumb unfunny bit has taken away from what should’ve been Quinta’s movement celebrating her first Emmy. Super disrespectful and inappropriate,” another comment read.</p><h2 id=how-did-quinta-brunson-respond-to-jimmy-kimmel-rsquo-s-bit-after-the-emmys>How Did Quinta Brunson Respond To Jimmy Kimmel’s Bit After The Emmys?</h2><p>Quinta Brunson might not have had the time to process how to react in the moment. However, she had the chance to think things through and was asked about the awkward experience afterwards. She was extremely gracious towards Jimmy Kimmel, explaining how he had always been supportive of her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I know Jimmy Kimmel, and I don’t know, I felt like the bit didn’t bother me that much. I don’t know what the internet thinks, [but] I know him… Jimmy gave me my first big late-night spot and was one of the first people to see Abbott,” Brunson said.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She went on to joke</a> that she would have the opportunity to get Kimmel back on her next appearance on his show. “In that moment I think I was just really happy that it was Jimmy up there. Tomorrow maybe I’ll be mad at him,” Brunson mulled. “I’m going to be on his show on Wednesday, so I might punch him in the face. I don’t know what happens.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmopmiurp5yqKkpp2cYq6vsIyqrKKmpJZ6o77Up6qopl8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rhop-cast-weigh-in-on-candiace-dillard-relationship-rumors.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'RHOP' Cast Weigh In on Candiace Dillard Relationship Rumors">&larr;
