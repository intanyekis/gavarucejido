He is most known for his time spent with the band’s Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.</p><p>It was in Dallas that a young Stephen Stills would spend his formative years. William Arthur Stills and Talitha Quintilla Collard were his parents. Stills was born into the military and grew up listening to blues and folk music as a result of his upbringing.</p><p>Stills was tested with partial hearing loss in one ear at the age of nine. As he aged, his hearing impairment worsened. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Stephen Stills admitted, “My hearing has become a severe problem.”</p><p>If I keep performing and traveling at this volume, I will eventually lose my hearing.</p><h2>What Happened to Graham Nash and Stephen Stills?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/market-stephen-stills-billboard-2022-bb8-brian-guido-1-pro-1260.webp alt="What Happened to Graham Nash and Stephen Stills?" width=942 height=623 sizes="(max-width: 942px) 100vw, 942px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Graham Nash and Stephen Stills, two-thirds of the legendary folk-rock group Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, are still with us today. Stills will turn 78 in 2023, and Nash will turn 81 on the first of February 2023.</p><p>The couple contributed vocals and musical skills on piano and guitar to the group’s sound. It appears that both Nash and Stills have maintained their musical careers through individual efforts and are currently actively playing.</p><p>As reported by Best Classic Bands, Stills performed live in December as part of a musical event. Nash’s website also features a number of forthcoming spring and summer tour dates.</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Are You Still Alive, Nick Chavez? how Did Nick Chavez Get Hurt?</a></p><h2>The Facebook death rumor about Stephen Stills continues to circulate.</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/slide-1-image-1024x374.webp alt="The Facebook death rumor about Stephen Stills continues to circulate." width=1024 height=374 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>On Sunday, a Facebook page titled “R.I.P. Stephen Stills” gathered almost one million “likes,” fueling rumors of the singer’s purported death.</p><p>The ‘About’ page gave a plausible explanation for the American singer’s death, saying: Hundreds of followers took to the Facebook page instantly, expressing their shock and grief over the loss of the 78-year-old singer, composer, and musician.</p><p>And, as usual, the death fake sent the Twitterverse into a frenzy. Some admirers took the tweet at its value, while others were instantly wary, possibly having learned their lesson from the plethora of hoaxes about celebrity deaths in recent months.</p><p>The death of a musician of Stephen Stills’s renown would be significant news across networks, thus some have pointed out that the news has not been reported on any major American network, suggesting it is a bogus tale.</p><p>According to a survey performed by the Celebrity Post, 89% of people no longer find the death rumors surrounding Stephen Stills to be humorous.</p><h2>Honors Are Led by Ex-Csny Members</h2><p>Stills, Nash, and Young paid tribute to their late bandmate on social media as the rock music community grieved.</p><p>Stills released a message on his various social media accounts in which he reflected on his friendship with Crosby through the years and paid tribute to him, calling him a “giant of a musician.”</p><p>On Instagram, Nash reflected on his connection with Crosby while praising the “wonderful music” and “amazing legacy” left by the late performer.</p><p>Young also posted a heartfelt tribute to his late bandmate on his website, in which he reflected on the “many amazing experiences” they had enjoyed during their early years of music-making together.</p><h2>Where does that leave their other band member, Neil Young?</h2><p>Yes, Neil Young is still with us; the artist recently turned 77 in November. After the publication of their first album in 1969, Crosby, Stills & Nash recruited Young to join the band. After he joined, the band changed their name to include his last name, and in 1970, they published their debut album with four members.</p><p>Young, like his old colleagues, has remained in the music industry throughout the years and, in November of last year, released an album with longtime partners Crazy Horse.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiho2LAtbHPoZynZaOptq240maqraGcoXqiuMivnGhpZ2uGcns%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-police-chief-larry-scirotto-fort-florida-officer-fired-after-he-was-accused-of-favoring-non-white-colleagues.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Police Chief Larry Scirotto?
