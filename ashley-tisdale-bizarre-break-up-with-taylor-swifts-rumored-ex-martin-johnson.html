While undoubtedly, some of these romantic rumors have turned out to be untrue, just the mere suggestion of a relationship with one of the most prominent singers in the world is enough to draw interest.</p><p>For example, in 2012, Taylor Swift was romantically linked with singer and songwriter Martin Johnson. While neither Swift nor Johnson confirmed nor denied the rumors, sources close to Swift insinuated that the relationship was real.</p><p>Mark Johnson later began dating singer and actress Ashley Tisdale.

Although <strong>Tisdale has been married to Christopher French </strong>since 2014, the star had been in a romantic relationship with <strong>musician, songwriter, and record producer Martin Johnson</strong>. Reports of <strong>Tisdale dating the former Boys Like Girls front-man</strong> began in early January 2012. As published by The Huffington Post, Tisdale and Johnson were spotted by the press and photographers leaving LAX in Los Angeles. According to the publication, the couple was returning to LA after spending a weekend together in New York City, wherein they celebrated New Year's Eve.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ashley-tisdale-looking-confident.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to US Weekly, <strong>Ashley Tisdale and Martin Johnson first met </strong>after the former starred in the "Love Drunk" music video for Johnson's punk rock band.

Still, her team didn't really feel that he was a good influence on her or her image." The anonymous source went one step further by alleging that Martin Johnson had been "Tackling some demons when he was linked to Swift but has apparently turned his life around now."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-sundance.jpg><p>While Tisdale's representatives informed US Weekly that her connection to Martin Johnson "wasn't serious," as they had just "gone on a few dates," the pair ultimately called it quits a few months after they celebrated the New Year together.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ashley-Tisdale.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Ashley Tisdale Joins Selena Gomez Fans To Roast 'The Good Fight' After Inappropriate Joke</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Ashley Tisdale took to Instagram to share a message regarding an inappropriate joke made about Selena Gomez.</span><p>However, the reason for their breakup was even more scandalous than the relationship itself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Sway's Universe radio show in 2016, <strong>Ashley Tisdale hinted that her ex-boyfriend was Martin Johnson </strong>without saying his name. The High School Musical actress also revealed the bizarre way in which <strong>Johnson allegedly broke up with her</strong>.</p><p>I dated a guy a while ago; he was a musician, and as he leaves, he goes, 'Ugh!' and I'm like, 'What's going on?; And he's like, 'Taylor Swift wrote a song about me.' And he leaves. I know Taylor, and later I asked her, 'Did you write this song about him?' she said, 'What? No. I never wrote a song about him.'</p><h2 id=did-taylor-swift-write-a-song-about-her-rumored-ex-boyfriend-martin-johnson>Did Taylor Swift Write A Song About Her Rumored Ex-Boyfriend Martin Johnson?</h2><p>It's no secret that <strong>Taylor Swift writes many of her songs based on her life experiences and past relationships</strong>. Swift's raw lyrics and heartfelt emotions are part of why she's been such a successful artist.</p><p>Even though Swift rarely, if ever, mentions who her songs are written about or for, she has nonetheless courted a lot of controversy and backlash over the years for 'exposing' the men she's dated. For example, while Taylor Swift has never confirmed that her song "Dear John" was about her supposed ex-boyfriend John Mayer, many fans, including Mayer himself, believe the song was about him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-billboard.jpg><p>As mentioned previously, <strong>Taylor Swift and Martin Johnson were good friends</strong> who collaborated on many songs, including some of Swift's most popular singles, such as "You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home" and "Two is Better Than One."
