They were both students at Spelman Circa College in 2006. However, it has been reported that Kareem and Morgan only started dating after they graduated.</p><p>Despite this, they had been together for about a decade. The pair confirmed their engagement on October 12, 2013. They married on the grounds of St. Philip Cathedral in Atlanta.</p><h2><span id=Learn_more_about_Kareem8217s_wife>Learn more about Kareem’s wife</span></h2><p>As previously said, she has created her own brand. Extending on it, the woman established her company to express her enthusiasm and love for cooking. Morgan, without a doubt, wanted the entire world to know about her easy, quick, and delicious cuisine.</p><p>Furthermore, the woman offers social gathering recommendations, including drink recipes and many more. She has a website called ineedsomemo.com as well as a YouTube channel.</p><h2><span id=A_Glorious_Wedding>A Glorious Wedding</span></h2><p>A total of 235 individuals attended Kareem’s wedding. The dinner reception, on the other hand, was hosted in the St. Regis Atlanta ballroom.</p><p>Furthermore, the groom has stated that their big day was just what they had envisioned, namely a classy traditional celebration with modern touches.</p><p>The groom donned a black suit with a plain white shirt and a black bow on one side, while the bride wore a simple tube white gown with her hair wrapped in a bun and side-parted. They were photographed hand in hand on the occasion.</p><h2><span id=The_baby_shower_for_his_second_child>The baby shower for his second child</span></h2><p>Kareem and his wife were spotted during their second child’s baby shower. Morgan planned a low-key gathering that included family and close friends. Elle, their first child, has already been born.</p><p>According to accounts, the event was captured on camera in front of their yard, with the name “Marley” in bold.</p><p>His wife was dressed to the knees in a white gown, their adorable daughter in a short-sleeved gown, and Kareem in white slacks and a brownish-orange shirt. The family walked down the street hand in hand, smiling.</p><h2><span id=Morgan_Harvey_is_an_adopted_child>Morgan Harvey is an adopted child</span></h2><p>Morgan Harvey is the adoptive daughter, as many of you are certainly aware. Morgan’s father is the famed comedian, radio personality, and daytime talk show host Steve Harvey. Morgan has a tight relationship with her father despite being adopted by Steve.</p><p>Morgan told Steve on his show that they had a father-daughter moment during her marriage, which she had not expected. She stated she’d remember that incredible moment for the rest of her life.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Scott Thompson Top On Body Enhancements And Plastic Surgery Disasters"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":37248,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/scott-thompson-top-on-body-enhancements-and-plastic-surgery-disasters/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/scott-thompson-top-on-body-enhancements-and-plastic-surgery-disasters/"}{"1":80}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Scott Thompson Top On Body Enhancements And Plastic Surgery Disasters</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>disc jockey</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Wax Motif</a></h3>Wax Motif estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
