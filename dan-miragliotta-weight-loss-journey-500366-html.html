His respiratory failure can be ascribed to the gigantic weight he acquired alongside his diet propensities. This drove him to decrease his weight, eat better food, and be more aware of his body.

According to a Youtuber, ‘The Freemelon Society,’ when somebody needs a fourfold detour method because of a respiratory failure, one can naturally expect that the patient’s diet was terrible. An individual can’t have extraordinary gatherings of waste, fats, and cholesterol in more than one supply route without a less than stellar eating routine. The heart condition will ultimately become serious when the veins in the four supply routes get obstructed. In the wake of confronting such a condition, it is nothing unexpected that Dan went through such an expensive and unsafe treatment.
