Some of his biggest roles were in movies such as Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), Dead Poets Society (1989), The Fisher King (1991), and Good Will Hunting (1997), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.</p><p>Sadly, <a href=#>Robin Williams struggled with substance abuse</a> and depression throughout his career. Later on in life, he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. Ultimately, Williams was found dead at his home in Paradise Cay, California, in 2014. His death was ruled a suicide and many believe it was caused by his depression. However, Williams’ widow, Susan Schneider recently revealed that the beloved actor’s struggles went beyond that, given that he had a strange disease that greatly affected his mental health.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:07</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/robin-williams-zelda-williams-and-susan-schneider-williams.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Robin Williams' Wife Susan Schneider Lost Everything Due To The Late Actor's Surprising Will</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Robin Williams' will caused several problems in court, especially with his widow, Susan Schneider.</span><h2 id=robin-williams-rsquo-wife-revealed-that-the-actor-suffered-from-more-than-depression>Robin Williams’ Wife Revealed That The Actor Suffered From More Than Depression</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/robin-williams-looking-emotional.jpg><p>Before his death, Robin Williams was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

His many symptoms included heightened levels of anxiety, delusions, and impaired movement. “They present themselves like a pinball machine,” Schneider explained. “You don’t know exactly what you’re looking at.”</p><p>Sadly, Williams’ symptoms worsened over time. In the months leading up to his death, the actor began experiencing crippling anxiety attacks, more symptoms of depression, and a “miscalculation” with a door that left his head bloodied and muscle rigidity.

And that was really irritating for him," Zak admitted. "When you're a performer, it goes beyond pride in what you're performing, it's your livelihood."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout this time, Zak and the rest of the family could do nothing but support the actor.
