Let's get started.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The 'Friends' Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></span></p><h2 id=matthew-perry-loved-going-off-script-and-trolling-his-fellow-cast-members-on-friends>Matthew Perry Loved Going Off Script And Trolling His Fellow Cast Members On Friends</h2><p>Throughout his journey on Friends, Matthew Perry felt at home alongside his castmates. The late actor did admit to struggling however, always wanting a laugh out of audience. Nonetheless, his contributions won't be forgotten as Perry put a smile on the face of millions, and that held true for his castmates as well.</p><p>As we're going to show in the video below posted to X, Perry never took himself too seriously, and he wasn't afraid to waste a take either. If a cast member made a mistake, Perry would be sure to on top of it in the following scene.</p><p>There were so many examples, like the time <strong><a href=#>Courteney Cox</a></strong> accidentally looked right into the camera. Perry would troll Cox in the following scene, looking directly into the camera, saying his line, "I know, what are we going to do."</p><p>Some of his classic off script moments can be seen below.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Bill Maher Was Emotional Over His Final Interview With Matthew Perry, Claiming Fans Had Him In The 'Dead Pool'</a></span></p><p>Without a doubt, Matthew Perry made the experience on Friends a better one for everyone around him.</p><h2 id=the-entire-cast-of-friends-loved-going-off-script-to-make-a-scene-better>The Entire Cast Of Friends Loved Going Off Script To Make A Scene Better</h2><p>Not only did <a href=#>Matthew Perry go off-script, like the time he trolled Matt LeBlanc</a> with the Q-tip joke, but the same held true for the rest of the cast throughout the series. <a href=#>David Schwimmer's iconic "I take thee Rachel" line was actually unscripted</a>, and inspired by a moment that took place off-camera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-29t173804-674.png><p>Other iconic scenes were also improvised by the cast.
