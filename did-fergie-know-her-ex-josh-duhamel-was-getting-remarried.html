Even though this famous couple is now divorced, they both are co-parenting when they aren't in the spotlight. The couple has maintained a good relationship since their breakup. Also, Fergie has since continued to support her ex-husband in his endeavors. But did she ever know Josh was getting married? What was her reaction after finding out about his wedding?</p><h2 id=what-was-fergie-rsquo-s-reaction-to-her-ex-husband-rsquo-s-engagement>What Was Fergie’s Reaction To Her Ex-Husband’s Engagement?</h2><p>On his Instagram earlier this year, Josh Duhamel announced his engagement to Audra Mari. In the Instagram caption, Josh wrote in January this year: “It’s on!! She found a message in a bottle that washed ashore and said YES!!”</p><p>The post featured a photo of the pair holding up a piece of paper, seemingly at a beach. The message on the paper can be seen to read: "Audra Diane Mari. Will you marry me?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Audra also commented on Josh's photo, saying, "I love you!!" She also posted their engagement photo on her Instagram, captioning it by saying, "my heart is so happy.. I love you @joshduhamel."</p><p>The actor was officially tying the knot for the second time after his divorce from singer Fergie.</p><p>The couple has since received well-wishes from a lot of people in the entertainment industry, including one from Josh’s ex-wife, Fergie. The Grammy Award singer sent her congratulations to the couple on their engagement and even provided a few green heart emojis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Report has it that Fergie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was full support to her ex-husband marrying Audra</a>. A close source of the singer revealed to the publication: “Fergie is happy about Josh and Audra. Fergie has met Audra several times and thinks she is an amazing woman.”</p><p>The source added, “Fergie and Josh have such an incredible co-parenting situation and they have much love for each other. They will always consider each other family and their son Axl knows this.

After their separation, the ex-couple kept the good vibes between them and shared a strong co-parenting relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fergie once said about their cordial relationship</a>, “We’re great friends, Josh and I; there’s so much love that we have for each other. We really like each other; we have fun with each other. We’re just not romantic couple anymore.”</p><p>The romance between the two was the only thing that changed for the couple.
