According to his fitness trainer Rakesh Udiyar, his transformation was a two-pronged process and included a highly-regimented workout routine and closely supervised diet plan. As Vicky has an ectomorphic body type, characterized by a fast metabolism and difficulty in gaining weight, his trainer prepared his diet plan to include a lot of carbs and proteins.</p><p>His diet plan was constructed in 3 different phases to achieve the desired body –</p><ul><li><strong>First Phase</strong> – The actor was put on a 6-meal-a-day plan, which meant he had to eat regularly at an interval of 3 hours. His calorie consumption was set to 2500, with more focus on <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>carbohydrates</a> and proteins, and carbs like <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>oats</a> and brown rice were included only in the first 3 meals of the day. Protein-rich foods like chicken (200 grams), fish, <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>mutton</a>, and <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>eggs</a> (8 eggs) became his staple diet in the first phase. He also supplemented it with vegetables, smoothies, and juices.</li><li><strong>Second Phase</strong> – In order to gain muscle, and not fat, Vicky was put on a <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>ketogenic diet</a>. Before working out, he would drink an 800-calorie smoothie of bananas, yogurt, and <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>berries</a>, twice a day, to rid his body of water retention from the earlier phase. Vicky consumed 3400 Calories daily and at the end of his keto diet, had put on a significant amount of weight.</li><li><strong>Third Phase</strong> – In the last phase, his diet was switched back to include lots of carbs and <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>proteins</a>. His daily consumption was set to 2000 calories.</li></ul><p>In preparation for his role, Vicky received boot-camp training for 2 months following which, he trained in <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>mixed martial arts</a> and military training for 5 months each. He would start his day at 6:30 am and hit the gym for 2 hours doing weight lifting exercises. It would be followed by an hour-long session in mixed martial arts in the afternoon. He would end his days by doing <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>military training</a> for 3 hours from 7 pm to 10 pm under a Sikh regiment at the Cuffe Parade in Mumbai. To make his muscles look more prominent, Vicky underwent the ‘Time Under Tension’ training in which he would lift heavy weights with 8 to 12 repetitions in each set to cause his muscles to grow faster (known as hypertrophy).</p><h3>Vicky Kaushal Favorite Things</h3><ul><li><b>Actors</b> – <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Hrithik Roshan</a>, <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Nawazuddin Siddiqui</a></li><li><strong>TV Shows</strong> – Game of Thrones, Prison Break</li><li><b>Film Directors </b>– Karan Johar, <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Anurag Kashyap</a></li><li><strong>Bollywood Films</strong> – Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai (2000), Black Friday (2004), Gangs of Wasseypur (2012), Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar (1992), Mughal-e-Azam (1960)</li><li><strong>Hollywood Film</strong> – 12 Angry Men (1957)</li><li><strong>Cuisine</strong> – Chinese</li><li><strong>Food</strong> – Pani Puri, Jalebi-Rabri, Aloo Paratha, Burger, Pizza</li><li><strong>Film By Anurag Kashyap</strong> –&nbsp;Black Friday (2004)</li><li><strong>Meal On The Film Set</strong> – Paratha with egg bhurji for breakfast</li><li><strong>Actress</strong> – <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Alia Bhatt</a></li></ul><p><strong>Source</strong> – Desimartini.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>YouTube</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>YouTube</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>YouTube</a>, BollywoodHelpline.com</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vicky-Kaushal-at-the-MAMI-Film-Festival-in-2017.jpg><h3>Vicky Kaushal Facts</h3><li>He grew up in an impoverished household and aspired to have a stable career after completing his studies.
