Quality films with meaty-roles are now casted to&nbsp;African American actors that have proven to draw hordes of fans to the box-office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gone are the 50’s and 60’s era when motion pictures where limited to ‘whites only’. Today, some of the highest paid actors making blockbuster hit films are African Americans.</p><p>Talk about movies like Training Day and Monster’s Ball that won both Denzel Washington and Halle Berry Oscars in 2002. How about Will Smith’s Men in Black and Training Day; Samuel L. Jackson’s Pulp Fiction, Morgan Freeman’s Million Dollar Baby, and Oscar-winning Jennifer Hudson’s Dreamgirls—all top grossing Black films. And the list can go on and on from movie actors, to top producers, and film directors.</p><p>With their incredible talent it’s not hard to understand why these&nbsp;African American actors are receiving so much love from movie fans all over the world and raking in big bucks from movie theaters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here’s a list of some of the highest paid and consequently richest African American actors in Hollywood today based on the net worth from <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>,&nbsp; <a href=#>Forbes</a> and other sources. Tyler Perry, who's the richest African American in Hollywood with an estimated net worth of $350 million, didn't feature in our list mainly because he is more of a producer and director. Let’s see who made the list.</p><h2 id=will-smith>1. Will Smith</h2><p><strong>Estimated net worth</strong>: $215 Million</p><p>Mention ‘Will Smith’ and movies like Men in Black and Hancock will immediately come to mind. Incidentally, Will pocketed a whopping $20 million talent fee for the latest installment of the hit Men in Black III, and around the same amount for the 2008 superhero film Hancock.</p><p>Will’s acting career began in a 90’s TV sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. But his career kicked-off after hit action movies Bad Boys and Independence Day, with the latter earning revenues of more than $800 million. Will also took home Grammy Awards for his rap music, and produced several films including Seven Pounds and I am Legend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Born to humble parents working as a school admin and refrigerator engineer, Will has come a long way with all the success he has earned. With his millions, Will can practically buy his mom her own school!</p><h2 id=2-samuel-l-jackson>2= Samuel L. Jackson</h2><p><strong>Estimated net worth</strong>: $150 Million</p><p>Samuel’s most recent box-office appearance were for the Marvel hit flicks Iron Man and Avengers, where he is said to have signed a contract for movie appearances in some nine other Marvel-related comic book movies… hello big bucks! Reports say he earns around $10 million each year.</p><p>With no interest in acting, Samuel was active in black student movements for civil rights in his younger years. It was only when he met actor Morgan Freeman that he was mentored in film and acting. His first movie was 1981’s Jungle Fever. Some of his important roles were in the movies Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction where he received an Oscar nominee, and Die Hard III.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Samuel remains a staunch advocate of civil rights especially for African American groups.</p><h2 id=2-denzel-washington>2= Denzel Washington</h2><p><strong>Estimated net worth</strong>: $150 Million</p><p>Denzel’s striking good looks and amazing acting skills are definitely paying off by the millions. Born and raised in New York, Denzel began his acting career in theater and slowly moved to made-for-TV-movies where he landed a role in St. Elsewhere and stayed with the TV show until its final season six years after. Around the same year, he received his first Oscar nomination for the film Cry Freedom, and the following year won Best Supporting Actor for his amazing performance in the film Glory.</p><p>Denzel is the second African American actor who ever won a Best Actor Oscar; he won for the movie Training Day. Denzel is an actor, scriptwriter, producer, and director with an annual pay of around $40 million. Now, that explains his $150 million net worth.</p><h2 id=martin-lawrence>4. Martin Lawrence</h2><p><strong>Estimated net worth</strong>: $110 Million</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whoever said comedy couldn’t earn millions?

He established his name in Hollywood after starring in hit movies Bad Boys, Blue Streak, and Big Momma’s House.</p><p>He started as a stand-up comedian with his own TV series in the 90’s called Martin which began bringing in big bucks to his career.</p><h2 id=ice-cube>5.

He was still in high school when his interest for hip-hop started, and he may never have thought he would be rapping his way to becoming a millionaire. His group N.W.A. performed at parties and influential events, until he left to go solo in 1989. He released albums such as Kill at Will that went gold and platinum in the hit charts! Cha-ching! He went on to create music that topped pop and R&B charts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While earning a great deal in music, Ice Cube began a shift to acting. His first movie was Boyz in the Hood, followed by others such as Higher Learning and Three Kings. And as if he wasn’t earning enough, Ice Cube went on to directing and producing films. Now, he’s worth millions of dollars!</p><h2 id=morgan-freeman>6. Morgan Freeman</h2><p><strong>Estimated net worth</strong>: $90 Million</p><p>No one will dare argue that Morgan Freeman is by far one of the most respected figures in US cinema.

His highly-respected status only demands a salary by the millions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Did you know that Morgan began his career on stage as a dancer first even before he went into acting?
