Born Emily Jean Stone in Scottsdale, Arizona in 1988, she has her mind made up to become an actress from an early age and began participating in the local theater. Confident in her acting abilities, Stone convinced her parents to move to California in 2004 to pursue an acting career. That happened to be the best decision of her life because 18 years later, she has a net worth of $40 million, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth,</a> and has even been recognized by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.</p><h2 id=her-early-acting-gigs>Her Early Acting&nbsp;Gigs</h2><p>Stone was so determined to become an actress when she moved to Los Angeles with her mother that she juggled doing online high school classes and working part-time at a dog-treat bakery while <a href=#>auditioning for acting gigs</a>. The story behind how her name changed from Emily to Emma was due to the name "Emily Stone" already being taken when she registered for the Screen Writer's Guild. However, that did not deter her and she persisted until landed her television debut on the VHI talent competition show for In Search of the New Partridge Family.&nbsp;She also appeared on the HBO comedy sitcom, Lucky Louie, created and <a href=#>executively produced by Louis C.K</a>. and in the short-lived Fox action drama Drive in 2007.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After getting some exposure from those small television roles, she went on to star in her film debut in 2007 in the teen comedy, Superbad, which grossed $170.8 million against a $20 million budget. Stone starred alongside budding actors Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and the <a href=#>veteran actor, screenwriter, and producer Seth Rogan.</a> The following year, she starred in both The Rocker, which flopped at the box office, and The House Bunny, opposite Anna Fannis and Kat Dennings which peaked at over $70 million at the box office.</p><p>=Around this time, Emma's star was beginning to rise as she was consistently landing more acting roles. In the year 2009, she was featured in three different films simultaneously. The first was Ghosts of Girlfriends Past which features a stellar cast of actors, including Hollywood's ladies man, Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner, Michael Douglas, Lacey Chabert, and Breckin Meyer, grossing a total of $102.4 million globally. The next film was Paper Man, where she co-starred with <a href=#>business wiz Ryan Reynolds</a> and Jeff Daniels. Zombieland was her final film of 2009 and it was a box office success at $102.4 million, spawning a sequel which did even better the first film. She shared the screen in the zombie comedy with Woody Harrelson, Jessie Eisenberg, Bill Murray, and the infamous Amber Heard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED:<a href=#> 8 Ways Ryan Gosling Earns And Spends His Money</a></strong></span></p><h2 id=a-supernova-among-stars>A Supernova Among Stars</h2><p>Emma's star power was really beginning to shine forth after the movies in which she appeared in 2009. With her days of television appearances behind her for the most part, she was increasing her value and becoming a more established actress. In 2010, she lent her voice to the live-action/computer-animated comedy Marmaduke, starring William H. Macy and <a href=#>comedian Owen Wilson</a>, grossing an easy $83 million. In the same year, she took the lead role in the teen romantic comedy, Easy A, starring alongside Amanda Bynes, Stanley Tucci, and Lisa Kudrow. This was the film in which she received her Hollywood breakthrough, grossing $75 million against a $8 million budget and winning an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance along with a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With her foot officially in the door for Hollywood success, she continued blazing her trail of success with her brief appearance in 2011's sex comedy, Friends With Benefits, starring <a href=#>famous pop singer Justin Timberlake</a> and Mila Kunis. She then appeared in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Crazy, Stupid, Love</a>, also a 2011 romantic comedy starring comedic actors Steve Carrell and Ryan Gosling, grossing $142.9 million at the box office. Her role led her to win the Choice Movie Actress - Comedy award at the 2012 Teen Choice Awards. 2011 awarded her even greater success in The Help, starring <a href=#>The Woman King's lead actress Viola Davis</a>, Ocatvia Spencer, and Jessica Chastain, which grossed a whopping $216.6 million against a $25 million budget. It was clear that Emma was on the go and had no intention of stopping.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then in 2013, she lent her voice to another computer-animated film, this time an adventure comedy called The Croods which earned a jaw-dropping $587.2 million at the box office and spawned a sequel in 2020. Emma then starred in the action thriller, Gangster Squad (2013), in which she co-starred beside<a href=#> Thanos' actor Josh Brolin</a>, Ryan Gosling, and Nick Nolte to name a top actors. But one of her most career-defining roles came in The Amazing Spider-Man in 2012 as Gwen Stacy, the love interest of Peter Parker, played by Andrew Garfield, and grossed $758 million, making it the highest-grossing movie of her career. She reprised her role in the 2014 sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 which also smashed the box office with $709 million.</p><h2 id=recent-movies-and-real-estate-investments>Recent Movies And Real Estate Investments</h2><p>Her most recent film successes include the 2016 romantic musical comedy-drama La La Land, starring Ryan Gosling and<a href=#> platinum-selling recording artist John Legend</a>, which grossed an amazing $448.9 million against a $30 million budget. For her leading role, Stone won the Academy, Golden Globe, and BAFTA Award for Best Actress. Going forward, she co-starred with Steve Carrell and comedian Sarah Silverman in Battle of The Sexes (2017), the black comedy The Favourite (2018), and Zombieland: Double Tap (2019) in which she reprised her role beside the normal cast and saw box office earnings of $125.213 million,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> according to The Numbers.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2020, Stone also reprised her voice-over role in The Croods sequel, The Croods: A New Age, <a href=#>alongside Nicolas Cage</a> and Ryan Reynolds which peaked at $214.834 at the box office. In 2021, she also played Cruella de Vil in Cruella, based on The One Hundred and One Dalmatians, alongside Emma Thompson which grossed $225 million worldwide. At only 33, Stone seems to have accomplished a great deal as an actress.</p><p>Stone's real estate portfolio is almost impressive as her movie resume. While it's nothing close to as extensive as<a href=#> Rihanna's home purchases,</a> she owns a house in Malibu which cost her $3.25 million and another home in Century City, Los Angeles which cost $2.3 million. However, in May 2022, she sold the Malibu property for $4.4 million. In addition, she bought a West Village condo in 2016 for $2.4 million and another condo in the Financial District for $3.6 million, both located in New York City.</p><p><span class=next-single><strong>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The 10 Highest-Grossing Emma Stone Movies Of All Time</a></strong></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Numbers</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSxqq3MqKWdq12Wu6V5z56Yq6SjYrWmvsSsZKGnp2KyrrnAZqqtp56aeqPByKWrZqCVp3p1fIymoKWkmaS7brHMqaCrnV8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jonadette-carpio-dating-affairs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Jonadette Carpio Dating Anyone?">&larr;
