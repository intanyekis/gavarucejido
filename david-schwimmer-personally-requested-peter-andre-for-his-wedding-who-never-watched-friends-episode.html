Despite his fame at the start, the actor always wanted to be viewed as an equal among his cast members.</p><p>His strategy worked as Friends thrived, while the cast would go on to make $1 million each per episode, in large part thanks to<strong> <a href=#>David Schwimmer's</a></strong> selfless ways.</p><p>In the following, we're going to take a look at a rare occurrence. David Schwimmer personally reached out to an artist and, as it turns out, this person had never watched Friends before. We'll take a look back at the secretive wedding, and how the artist felt about being included. In addition, we'll reveal another major actor who admitted to never watching Friends before. He also made the reveal in front of David Schwimmer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>David Schwimmer Almost Banned His Friends Offer After A Traumatic Hollywood Experience On A Different Sitcom</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=peter-andre-revealed-david-schwimmer-requested-that-he-sing-at-his-wedding-to-zoe-buckman>Peter Andre Revealed David Schwimmer Requested That He Sing At His Wedding To Zoe Buckman</h2><p>Ahead of the Friends reunion a couple of years back, Peter Andre made quite the reveal. He admitted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Schwimmer had asked him to sing at his star-studded wedding to Zoe Buckman</a>. Although this would be a huge deal for most artists, Andre admits he had never watched a single episode of the show. Nonetheless, he had a great time at the wedding. He met Schwimmer at a hotel in London to confirm the gig.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar51751072.jpg><p>Andre reveals, "I know everyone is really excited about the Friends reunion, but I've actually never watched a single episode! Bizarrely, I did sing at David Schwimmer's wedding in 2010, though."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I got a call saying he wanted to meet me and I thought it was a wind-up. I went to a London hotel to meet him and we started talking and he said to me "I'd love you to sing at our wedding."</p><p>"And so I did. It was definitely strange seeing Thandiwe Newton and David Walliams in the same room, singing along to a song I never even knew they knew. It was wonderful."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>A Guest Star On Friends Claims Matthew Perry Made Her Career Because Of Their Storyline On The Show</a></span></p><p>At the time of the wedding back in 2010, Schwimmer and his former partner Buckman were very secretive about the entire process and, in fact, the news only leaked to the media months after their wedding day.</p><h2 id=david-schwimmer-and-zoe-buckman-were-very-secretive-about-their-wedding>David Schwimmer And Zoe Buckman Were Very Secretive About Their Wedding</h2><p>It took a little while for the media to catch on as to what had taken place between Schwimmer and Buckman. People revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Schwimmer secretly married Buckman</a>, and that it took four months for the media and others to finally realize it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People writes, "The two tied the knot in a small private ceremony in early June after having reportedly met in London in 2007, at the time Schwimmer was directing the romantic movie comedy Run, Fat Boy, Run, starring Simon Pegg and Thandie Newton."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar45314410.jpg><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Matthew Perry Revealed The One Strict Rule The Cast Of Friends Never Dared To Break</a></span></p><p>Sadly, after seven years of marriage, David Schwimmer and Zoe Buckman got a divorce. To this day, it seems like David Schwimmer is single. The two issued a joint statement following their separation.</p><p>They wrote, "It is with great love, respect and friendship that we have decided to take some time apart while we determine the future of our relationship."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Our priority is, of course, our daughter's happiness and well-being during this challenging time, and so we ask for your support and respect for our privacy as we continue to raise her together and navigate this new chapter for our family."</p><p>The two are still very much co-parenting on amicable terms despite the split.</p><h2 id=david-schwimmer-had-another-encounter-with-an-a-list-celeb-who-had-never-watched-friends-before>David Schwimmer Had Another Encounter With An A-List Celeb Who Had Never Watched Friends Before</h2><p>That's right, there are others in this world of a certain age that haven't watched Friends either. One of those A-listers happens to be Mark Ruffalo, who made the reveal during an interview with Schwimmer on The Graham Norton Show. Schwimmer didn't seem bothered by the moment, while Ruffalo did feel bad for making the reveal.</p><p>Tamsin Greig also added to the moment, revealing she didn't know who Matt LeBlanc was after he was cast in the successful comedy series, Episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Credit to Schwimmer, who kept in good spirits throughout the interview despite the reveals. In addition, Schwimmer was praised by fans for his conduct during the interview.</p><p>"I want to see more David Schwimmer! He is truly funny, no matter if it’s the 90s, 2000s or now. Out of all those amazing actors, he steals the show without trying," on fan writes.</p><p>The most liked comment reads, "I don't know why Schwimmer never tried his hand at stand-up comedy. His facial expressions are priceless and, he's quick-witted."</p><p>Clearly, all these years later, David Schwimmer is still impressing audiences worldwide. In truth, the audience isn't wrong, seeing Schwimmer in more projects wouldn't be a bad thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6ZmXq0r8ewoKallad6sbHRrKanmZyhxm6%2BxKqsnqukmrFuvMStnKtlkaOxs7GMn6arZZiewG7DxJ2boqaXYsSpu4ynnK%2BdomLEosDCoZydZZantqa6w6xknqiZqLylsY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-anna-osceola-jon-hamm-wife-age-instagram-and-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Anna Osceola?
