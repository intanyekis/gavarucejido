Much like other celebrities, they are frequently followed around by the paparazzi.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the age of the Internet and modern technology, this allows fans to get a glimpse of Superstars and Divas outside of the ring, taking a look at time spent outside of the WWE, with families and significant others, and participating in activities that don’t involve slamming an opponent’s face into the mat. However, the downside of being trailed by the paparazzi is that sometimes, embarrassing moments are caught for the world to see.</p><p>These photos are often posted online, shared through social media, and reach millions of people in almost no time at all. While most wrestlers try to stay on their best behavior, especially when they know that the cameras are watching, it is just inevitable that embarrassing moments will be caught on camera and&nbsp;put on public display.</p><p>Photos and videos that show a different side to these professional athletes can circulate in just minutes. Here, we have a list of 20 of the most embarrassing WWE Superstar moments caught by the paparazzi.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=20-big-show-takes-cheating-out-of-the-ring><strong>20. Big Show Takes Cheating Out of the Ring</strong></h2><p>With his recent linkup with The Authority, WWE fans have seen that <a href=#>The Big Show</a> is not above cheating when it comes to winning a match. Big Show took this same mode of thinking outside of the ring when he was involved in a street match – with a member of the paparazzi from media outlet TMZ. The giant and the much smaller photographer engaged in a heated thumb wrestling match. Not unlike his character in the ring, Big Show helped himself out by using his index finger and referring to it as “outside interference.” The video of the match was then added to the gossip outlet’s website. This moment was a little embarrassing for the wrestler, who’s known to some fans as a “sellout,” but it appears that it was all in good fun.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=19-kaitlyn-gets-arrested-and-it-s-unscripted><strong>19. Kaitlyn Gets Arrested…and It’s Unscripted</strong></h2><p>In 2012, WWE Diva Kaitlyn made her way to a live event in Michigan as she did for any other event. However, this time, instead of entering the ring, she was escorted away from the arena in a police car. It turns out, the Diva had an old parking ticket that was never paid. Police knew of her presence and came to the arena to serve her with a warrant. After taking her mugshot, which was made available to the public, Kaitlyn was released on a $315 bond. She addressed the incident on social media, stating that she was fully cooperating with the authorities to clear up the old ticket and warrant.</p><p></p><h2 id=18-seth-rollins-needs-a-police-escort><strong>18. Seth Rollins Needs a Police Escort</strong></h2><p>Seth Rollins has built quite an empire for himself in the WWE, turning on members of The Shield to join The Authority. In the PG Era, he has been one of the biggest and most hated heels in the industry as of late. In fact, things have gotten so out of control with his character, the WWE’s hotel was heavily guarded in August 2015. When he went to leave to go to a restaurant with his girlfriend Zahra Schreiber, a police escort had to accompany the two so that there was no trouble. The barricade and Rollins meeting with police to be able to safely go to the restaurant were all caught on camera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=17-cm-punk-freaks-over-wedding-photo-leak><strong>17. CM Punk Freaks Over Wedding Photo Leak</strong></h2><p>Former WWE star <a href=#>CM Punk</a> has never been known in the WWE Universe as being the “nice guy.” However, he took his bad boy reputation a step further when photos of his wedding to former WWE Diva Champion AJ Lee were leaked on social media. The identity of the person who released the two photos, one of the smiling couple and another of them cutting the cake, was never identified, and it’s unknown as to whether it was a guest or member of the paparazzi that broke the story. However, CM Punk went on an embarrassing rant after the leak, threatening to block anyone that further shared the photos and lacing the rant with colorful language. He quickly removed the post, but not before screenshots were made and shared through the Internet.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=16-maryse-mizanin-breaks-down-after-confrontation-with-the-paparazzi><strong>16. Maryse Mizanin Breaks Down After Confrontation with the Paparazzi</strong></h2><p>Maryse Mizanin, known just as Maryse, is a model and former WWE wrestler. She is also known for being the wife of Mike Mizanin, known inside of the ring as <a href=#>The Miz</a>. During the 2008 Summerslam tournament, Maryse was taking photos in a hotel lobby, when she was approached by a member of the paparazzi wielding a camera. Bystanders claimed that Maryse, feeling threatened, grabbed her things and ran, all as she was taking photos with a wheelchair-bound fan. The paparazzo proceeded to talk badly about Maryse, telling the fan that she didn’t want to take photos with someone in a wheelchair. Maryse emerged later, in tears, and rumors swirled around the Internet about the incident. However, several witnesses gave their own account of the story, stating that Maryse was not at fault.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-the-miz-rants-on-camera><strong>15. The Miz Rants On Camera</strong></h2><p>If <a href=#>The Miz</a>’s wife is on the list, then surely The Miz, known for his outbursts and his cocky behavior, would have a memorable paparazzi moment, and the wrestler does not disappoint. In 2010, The Miz was attending an event when he was filmed by a TMZ photographer. Miz appeared to be in character as he went on an almost 5-minute rant about TMZ, Jersey Shore, and The Real World, the show where he got his start and first debuted his love for wrestling. The long rant just shows how crazy Miz, whose real name is Mike Mizanin, can be in and out of the ring.</p><p></p><h2 id=14-cameron-uses-ray-j-to-get-more-exposure><strong>14. Cameron Uses Ray J to Get More Exposure</strong></h2><p>Former WWE Diva and current NXT competitor Cameron was shown on Total Divas devising a way to get more exposure. After a failed trip out with her boyfriend, she enlisted the help of a famous friend, rapper Ray J, brother of singer Brandy Norwood and infamously known for making a sex tape with Kim Kardashian. The two worked out together in a gym, fully aware of photographers snapping their photos as they took intimate photos. This scene was embarrassing for two reasons: One, because she had to act out of a scene with someone famous to get exposure. Two, because&nbsp;she had a long-term boyfriend while she was putting herself in compromising positions with the rapper.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=13-oops-cameron-does-it-again><strong>13. Oops, Cameron Does It Again!</strong></h2><p>Cameron makes the list twice for her need to be seen by the paparazzi. Before she enlisted Ray J to help her get noticed by the paparazzi, Cameron and her boyfriend Vinnie went for a stroll in an area where she knew there would be photographers. As the two walked down the street, multiple photos were taken to the delight of Cameron. However, none of these photos ever appeared in print or online publications. It turns out, Kim Kardashian was also in the area, and her appearance took the focus off of Cameron. This incident was caught on film by Total Divas and was a pretty embarrassing and desperate attempt by Cameron to get her name out to the public.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-a-paparazzo-gets-embarrassed-while-taking-pictures-of-melina><strong>12. A Paparazzo Gets Embarrassed While Taking Pictures of Melina</strong></h2><p>A setup for a WWE entrance actually left a paparazzo embarrassed, all while it was filmed by WWE cameras. As the beautiful Melina entered the arena, paparazzi stood in front of her and took pictures, walking backwards to catch every moment. One photographer lost his balance while walking backward and took a spill, which was caught by the WWE. Melina kept up her confident strut after giving the man a pat on the back. While a WWE star wasn’t involved in this incident, it just goes to show that no one, even the paparazzi, is&nbsp;immune from having embarrassing moments caught on tape.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-cm-punk-calls-out-hulk-hogan><strong>11. CM Punk Calls Out Hulk Hogan</strong></h2><p><a href=#>CM Punk</a> is never one to remain quiet, and he certainly showed just how outspoken he is while attending a Chicago Blackhawks hockey game. CM Punk, who is a fan of the Blackhawks, was not happy with comments <a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a> had made about the team. While on camera for CSN, CM Punk went on a tirade that called out the Legend, calling him “a piece of garbage.” Many people have speculated whether the former wrestler was simply staying true to his bad boy image or if he was completely serious. In any case, the footage was aired and has since been circulating to show that CM Punk just doesn’t know when to keep his mouth shut.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-stacy-keibler-has-a-wardrobe-malfunction><strong>10. Stacy Keibler Has a Wardrobe Malfunction</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Stacy Keibler</a> was once one of the most beautiful and toughest females to step foot in the WWE ring. After her departure from the WWE, she went on to become an actress and stayed in the spotlight for once dating world-famous actor <a href=#>George Clooney</a>. While at the Monaco Grand Prix with Clooney, Keibler had an unfortunate wardrobe malfunction as her zipper broke, revealing her skimpy, hot pink underwear. The moment was caught by paparazzi, who didn’t seem to alert Keibler to the malfunction until it had all been caught on film and shared over the Internet and through various media outlets.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-chyna-stays-in-the-news-for-her-wild-antics><strong>9. Chyna Stays in the News for Her Wild Antics</strong></h2><p>Former WWE wrestler Chyna, known to some fans as the 9th Wonder of the World, has been a gossip column fixture for years now, and just one moment can’t be named as the most embarrassing. Moments caught on tape include an awkward dancing/twerking moment, her celebrity sex tape, beating up her friends, and accusing <a href=#>Triple H</a> and others within the organization of abuse and poor treatment. These moments have all been embarrassing, and many have been caught on tape and have made their rounds on the Internet. So many odd things have happened, in fact, that many people have questioned whether the former star needs to seek professional help.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-the-beginnings-of-john-cena-and-nikki-bella><strong>8. The Beginnings of John Cena and Nikki Bella</strong></h2><p><a href=#>John Cena</a> and Nikki Bella are one of the power couples of the WWE, much like Stephanie McMahon and Triple H, as well as her twin sister Brie Bella and husband Daniel Bryan. However, the beginning of their relationship was a little bit awkward. Fresh off the divorce from his wife, Cena was caught by paparazzi attending the high school reunion of Nikki as her date. This normally wouldn’t be embarrassing – except Cena had filed for divorce from his wife out of the blue earlier in the year. While no one knows the true story behind the breakup, some fans had speculated that Cena was having affairs with his coworkers, and the shots of him and Bella only seemed to fuel the fires of the rumor mill.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-chris-jericho-almost-incites-a-riot><strong>7. Chris Jericho Almost Incites a Riot</strong></h2><p>In 2012, <a href=#>Chris Jericho</a> was going head-to-head with <a href=#>CM Punk</a> at a live WWE event in Brazil. Trying to get the crowd worked up, he found a Brazilian flag beside the ring, picked it up, kicked it, and then threw it out of the ring. He didn’t get the reaction he was looking for. In fact, things soon got out of control. Jericho was confronted by police and made to apologize or face jail time. He chose to apologize, and the match resumed. The incident was caught on tape and made its rounds on the Internet and because of the incident, Jericho was suspended by the WWE.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-hulk-hogan-gets-caught-with-a-beautiful-blonde-his-daughter><strong>6. Hulk Hogan Gets Caught With a Beautiful Blonde—His Daughter!</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a> is one of the most famous and popular wrestlers of all time. However, after his TV show Hogan Knows Best aired and as paparazzi photos of WWE stars began to show up online, many fans began to wonder about his&nbsp;relationship with his daughter, Brooke. When photos surfaced of the Legend slathering tanning oil on the backside of his daughter, fans were a little shocked, and some were grossed out by the close relationship. Hulk continued to raise eyebrows after the incident by posting a photo on social media of his daughter’s legs, even captioning it, “Brooke’s legs.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-tommy-dreamer-and-opponent-out-gross-each-other><strong>5. Tommy Dreamer and Opponent Out-Gross Each Other</strong></h2><p>Former WWE star Tommy Dreamer has since made a name for himself working the independent circuit. While embroiled in a tag-team match with Joey Ryan and Candice LaRae, he became very visibly upset when Ryan sucked on a lollipop throughout the match. Tommy Dreamer took the lollipop and stuck it in his mouth, and this turned into a disgusting back and forth between the two, who shoved the lollipop in their pants before passing it back. This moment was very real and very disturbing for anyone who saw it that night…as well as online fans who saw the scene because it was all caught on camera.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-x-pac-tears-himself-a-new-one><strong>4. X-Pac Tears Himself a New One</strong></h2><p>After his departure from the WWE, wrestler X-Pac began working on the independent circuit. While things seemed to be going well for the wrestler, one bad move at a live event in Minneapolis severely injured him…and was all caught on camera. During the event, X-Pac was supposed to perform his signature Bronco Buster. When opponent Horace the Psychopath moved out of the way, X-Pac was supposed to land on the turnbuckle. He mistimed his move and ended up crashing into the uncovered section of the turnbuckle. The video shows him in visible pain, and it’s no wonder – he went to the hospital when he noticed profuse bleeding and had to undergo an emergency sphincterplasty to repair a torn anus!</p><p></p><h2 id=3-scott-hall-gets-thrown-out-of-live-event><strong>3. Scott Hall Gets Thrown Out of Live Event</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Scott Hall</a> earned a reputation during the Attitude Era as a bad boy. It seems that he may have taken his role a little too seriously, as evidenced by an appearance at a live event in May of 2015. During the event, which took place in New Jersey, Hall was set to have a meet and greet with fans. However, fans and staff at the event quickly noticed that Hall had been drinking. And he wasn’t just a little tipsy, either – he appeared to be completely hammered, and some of it was caught on camera and posted online. After disappointing fans with his disheveled, drunken antics, Hall was soon escorted out of the event. Hall has been known to have suffered from various addictions for many years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-jake-the-snake-lets-his-demons-get-the-best-of-him><strong>2. Jake the Snake Lets His Demons Get the Best of Him</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jake the Snake Roberts</a> is almost as known for his addictive habits as he is for his wrestling skills and in-ring use of snakes. At an event in Ohio in 2008, all of this came to a head when he shocked fans with a tirade that was all caught on tape by paparazzi. Bystanders said that he was aggressive, violent, and asked for drugs after waking up backstage. After his opponent chewed him out for his behavior, Roberts did the unthinkable by pulling down his pants and showing a private part to the crowd. Roberts was not arrested for the outburst, and his rep refused to comment on the situation.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-hulk-hogan-s-legacy-is-destroyed-with-just-one-tape><strong>1. Hulk Hogan’s Legacy Is Destroyed with Just One Tape</strong></h2><p>While this wasn’t necessarily caught by the paparazzi, it was obtained and leaked online by an unknown source and was quickly picked up by news and gossip websites. In 2012, <a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a> filmed a sex tape with his friend’s wife. While that is shocking in itself, what came next destroyed everything Hulk had worked for. In the tape, he made several racist comments that left wrestling fans’ jaws on the floor. The shocking rants not only stunned the world, but they also spurred the WWE to take action. After the release of the tape and confirmation by Hulk that it was him featured on the tape, WWE removed all videos and memorabilia of him from the site and immediately removed him from the Hall of Fame and ended his contract with the organization.</p><p>Sources: <a href=#>tmz.com</a>, <a href=#>huffingtonpost.com</a>, <a href=#>sports.yahoo.com</a>, <a href=#>baltimoresun.com</a>, <a href=#>thesportster.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0e5FpZJ6lkpa%2Fs63SrKCnn12sxKZ50q6nnqqjqa6zecyopJ6mpKh6pK3PrayrnZRir7p5z5qnmqqRr8eqew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./amy-winehouses-dress-sells-for-67000-20112911.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amy Winehouse's Dress Sells for $67,000!">&larr;
