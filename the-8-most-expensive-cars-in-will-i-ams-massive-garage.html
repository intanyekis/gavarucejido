When Fergie joined to create a quarter, their third album <i>Elephunk</i> became a massive hit worldwide. Along with the band's success, will.i.am also focused on his solo career and released his tracks. He used his producing skills to create beats for notable artists like U2, Britney Spears, Justin Bieber, <a href=#>and Michael Jackson</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With a net worth of $70 million, will.i.am has spent the majority of his net worth on cars.
