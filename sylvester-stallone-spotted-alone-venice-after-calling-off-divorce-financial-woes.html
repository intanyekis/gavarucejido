In her filing, she accused her estranged husband of “[engaging] in the intentional dissipation, depletion and/or waste of marital assets which has had an adverse economic impact on the marital estate."</p><p>As such, her divorce documents requested that "the Husband should be enjoined from, selling, transferring, assigning, encumbering, or dissipating any assets during the pendency of these proceedings."</p><p>At the time, specifics of Jennifer's allegations remained ambiguous.

"There was a reawakening of what was more valuable than anything, which is my love for my family. It takes precedence over my work, and that was a hard lesson to learn."</p><p>The actor also admitted to not being as present with his children and wife as he should’ve been. In addition to the three daughters he shares with Jennifer, he has three older children from his first marriage to actress Sasha Czack.</p><p>"I didn't pay enough attention when they were growing up," Sylvester explained.
