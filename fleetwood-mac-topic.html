The lyrics explore the themes of heartbreak and loneliness as the singer tries to come to terms with the end of a relationship. The opening lines of the song set the tone for the rest of it: "Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom, well who am I to keep you down?" The singer accepts that the relationship is over and that the other person wants their freedom, but she also acknowledges the pain she feels in her loneliness. The line "It's only right that you should play the way you feel it" suggests that the other person should be true to themselves, but it also implies a sense of resignation that the singer must accept their decision regardless of how it makes her feel.</p><br><p>The chorus of the song, with the line "Thunder only happens when it's raining", is the most iconic part of the song. This line is a metaphor for the turmoil that accompanies a breakup. The next line, "Players only love you when they're playing", suggests that those who claim to love you may not be sincere, and they only love you when they are getting something out of it. The final line, "Say women, they will come and they will go, when the rain washes you clean, you'll know", is an acknowledgement that relationships are temporary and that one must be willing to accept the heartbreak that comes with them.</p><br><p>Overall, "Dreams" is an incredibly powerful song that resonates with people of all ages and backgrounds. It explores the universal themes of love, loss, and heartbreak in a way that is both captivating and heart-wrenching.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Now here you go again</u><br>The singer is acknowledging that someone is entering into a new phase of their life.</p><br><p><u>You say you want your freedom</u><br>The singer understands that this person wants to be free and do what they want.</p><br><p><u>Well, who am I to keep you down?</u><br>The singer admits that they have no right to hold the person back.</p><br><p><u>It's only right that you should</u><br>The artist accepts that the person deserves to live their life as they choose.</p><br><p><u>Play the way you feel it</u><br>The artist encourages the person to be true to themselves.</p><br><p><u>But listen carefully</u><br>The singer advises the person to be aware of their feelings and emotions.</p><br><p><u>To the sound of your loneliness</u><br>The singer tells the person to pay attention to their own loneliness and how it affects them.</p><br><p><u>Like a heartbeat drives you mad</u><br>The artist is describing how the loneliness can consume a person like a constant, driving force.</p><br><p><u>In the stillness of remembering what you had</u><br>The artist describes how the person may become lost in their memories of what they once had.</p><br><p><u>And what you lost</u><br>The artist acknowledges that the person has also experienced loss of what they once had.</p><br><p><u>Oh, thunder only happens when it's rainin'</u><br>The singer explains that things only get crazy and turbulent during difficult times.</p><br><p><u>Players only love you when they're playin'</u><br>The artist warns that some people may only show affection when it benefits them.</p><br><p><u>Say women, they will come and they will go</u><br>The singer acknowledges the fleeting nature of relationships with women.</p><br><p><u>When the rain washes you clean, you'll know</u><br>The singer suggests that tough times can make you stronger and cleanse you of negativity.</p><br><p><u>Now here I go again</u><br>The singer is admitting that they are also entering into a new phase of their life.</p><br><p><u>I see the crystal visions</u><br>The artist is describing experiencing imaginative and clear thoughts about the future.</p><br><p><u>I keep my visions to myself</u><br>The artist is keeping their daydreams private and close to their heart.</p><br><p><u>It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams</u><br>The singer admits that they are the only one who wants to share in this person's dreams.</p><br><p><u>And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?</u><br>The singer is inquiring if the person has any ambitions they would like to share with them.</p><br><p><u>Dreams of loneliness</u><br>The artist acknowledges that the person may have dreams rooted in their feelings of isolation.</p><br><p><u>Ooh, what you lost</u><br>The artist repeats the idea of losing something, further emphasizing the pain of this loss.</p><br><p><u>You will know</u><br>The artist reassures the person that they will gain insights and understanding through their experiences.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd.<br>Written by: Stephanie Nicks</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maH6cmrK1w86om5iFkZisbquzqKeim195v6atzKw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-did-chris-rock-escape-burning-man-festival-comedian-found-himself-in-muddy-chaos-that-left-73-000-people-trapped.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How did Chris Rock escape Burning Man festival?
