He was talking about suicide and arguing with people who were trying to comfort him. At some point the police turned up outside his apartment.</p><p>More than 200 people were watching the stream when he died, including Mr Steen and several of his friends.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ronnie-mcnutt-suicide-video-explored></span>Ronnie McNutt: Suicide Video Explored<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Clips showing his death started going viral the day after his suicide.</p><p>“The video was public and his account was public. Whoever took the first clip and uploaded it created a back story about Ronnie,” said Mr Steen.</p><p>“None of it was true. But it helped fuel the fire to help it spread,” he added.</p><p>On Mr McNutt’s Facebook page, more and more comments were being posted. Many were unpleasant and Mr Steen reported them to the social network as harassment.</p><p>But he said Facebook told him nothing could be done because he was not the account holder.</p><p>Meanwhile, several online funding pages were set up in Ronnie’s honour. But they were not authorised by the family and Mr Steen is unclear what, if anything, was being done about it.</p><p>“It got so out of hand. We watched it circle the globe. When a person in Australia says their nine-year-old child had seen this on TikTok, it’s crushing.”</p><p>He is aware that many will argue Mr McNutt should never have filmed his death in this manner and that others will blame him for the psychological damage inflicted on those seeing the video.</p><p>But Mr Steen remains loyal to his friend.</p><p>“I don’t think that was his intention when he started the live,” he said.</p><p>“When you go back and follow his digital trail there is this beautiful telling of his life on various social-media platforms. He had a history of getting on a streaming service and talking.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHq4rdJmqaimnp6ybrnCp6ytrF2owqqvyJ2cZq6ZmbKwecSxp6WnopqxcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cardi-b-denies-money-is-the-reason-she-didnt-divorce-offset.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cardi B Denies Money Is The Reason She Didnt Divorce Offset">&larr;
