However, when they dated for the first time, she was only 16 years old!</p><p class=dh>Most of the details of Minaj and Petty’s relationship have been kept under wraps. The couple became Instagram official on December 9, 2018, when Minaj shared a photo of her man wearing a red outfit while <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BrL-wSBnqO4/>holding up one of her legs</a>.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>[In 2006], Minaj’s husband was sentenced to 10 years in prison.</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/dec96e5e2c4eaf3f34d4088baf42fc15.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Nicki Minaj on March 31, 2010 in New York City | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>NICKI MINAJ AND KENNETH PETTY’S LOVE STORY</strong></p><p class=dh>From that point on, she kept posting more pics and videos of Petty on social media with lovely captions. A few days after their first post together, for example, she admitted that Petty <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BrWBJ2TAPQy/>wanted her to be his wife</a>.</p><p class=dh>At the time, it was not taken so seriously, but it was one of the hints that Minaj shared about the future of her and Petty’s relationship.</p><p class=dh>Then, in June 2019, the rapper revealed that she and Kenneth Petty had got <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/pregnant-nicki-minajs-husband-kenneth-petty-5-things-to-know/he-goes-by-a-nickname/>their marriage license</a>. Their wedding seemed to be around the corner, but their license expired before they tied the knot.</p><p class=dh>In September that year, Minaj <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8533743/who-did-nicki-minaj-marry-kenneth-petty>teased her retirement</a> from the music industry, claiming that she wanted to focus on starting a family – another hint.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>NICKI MINAJ SECRETLY MARRIED KENNETH PETTY</strong></p><p class=dh>Only one month later, on October 22, 2019, Nicki Minaj announced that she officially <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B357b7xHN_0/>married Kenneth Petty</a>. She didn’t share any information about the ceremony, though.</p><p class=dh>Instead, she just uploaded a short video of two coffee mugs – one had “Mrs.” and the other had “Mr.” written on the outside – and two hats – one said “Bride,” and the other one “Groom.”</p><p class=dh>For the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B357b7xHN_0/>caption</a>, Minaj wrote the date of the ceremony – October 21, 2019 – and her real name with her husband’s last name at the end – Onika Tanya Maraj-Petty.</p><p class=dh>Following her wedding, she told rapper <a class="me a" href=#>Lil Wayne</a> on his show “Young Money Radio” that she couldn’t complain about her married life and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/pregnant-nicki-minajs-husband-kenneth-petty-5-things-to-know/he-goes-by-a-nickname/>even labeled Petty</a> as her “soulmate.”</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>NICKI MINAJ’S PREGNANCY</strong></p><p class=dh>Several months went by, and nothing out of the ordinary seemed to be going on in their relationship as she kept posting photos and videos of them, just like she had been doing since late 2018.</p><p class=dh>On July 20, 2020, <a class="me a" href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> announced on Instagram that she was expecting her first child. The four images that she uploaded broke the internet as she showed off her big baby bump while wearing tiny and colorful outfits.</p><p class=dh>One of the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CC3zixqDZTj/>most beautiful photos</a> that the rapper uploaded to share the big news showed her posing in a gorgeous white dress while being surrounded by trees and tall grass. There was also a sort of halo around her that attracted a lot of attention.</p><p class=dh>The due date of Nicki Minaj and her husband’s baby is still unclear, but judging by her social media posts and the recurrent displays of affection shown by the couple, that child will grow up in a house filled with love.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>KENNETH PETTY’S CRIMINAL HISTORY</strong></p><p class=dh>Kenneth Petty’s life has not been flawless, though. In 1995, when he was a teenager, he was convicted of <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8533743/who-did-nicki-minaj-marry-kenneth-petty>attempted rape</a>. For that crime, he was sentenced to 18 to 54 months in jail.</p><p class=dh>Shortly after Petty’s criminal history was made public, Minaj defended him by saying that when the incident took place, he was 15 years old, the victim was 16, and they were dating.</p><p class=dh>In a different case, Petty was accused and eventually pleaded guilty (in 2006) to manslaughter charges. The incident took place in 2002, and Lamont Robinson passed away as a result of gunfire.</p><p class=dh>Minaj’s husband was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but according to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/music/nicki-minaj-new-boyfriend-kenneth-zoo-petty-everything-to-know/>People</a>, he only served seven years behind bars as he was on a supervised release program between 2013 and 2018.</p><p class=dh>In March this year, Petty made headlines again. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9330776/kenneth-petty-facing-federal-charges-register-sex-offender>Billboard</a> reported that he was facing federal charges for failing to register as a sex offender even though the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office dropped the charges.</p><p class=dh>Kenneth Petty was taken into custody, pleaded not guilty on March 4, and was released on a $100,000 bond. The outcome of that case is still unknown.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtocm1lbnqssc2nnK2gXaWytcDYZqCsZZ6esKy1jKagp5maqHqpwdKbmKecXZuub7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./niana-guerrero.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Niana Guerrero Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More">&larr;
