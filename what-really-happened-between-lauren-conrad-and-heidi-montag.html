Fans were first introduced to the show back in 2006, which starred Heidi Montag, Audrina Patridge, Whitney Port, and of course, Lauren Conrad. The show was a <a href=#>spin-off of LC's previous reality series</a>, Laguna Beach, though viewers now had a few new faces to meet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the show's peak, it was bringing in more ratings than Sex & The City and The Sopranos combined, proving just how big a phenomenon the show truly was. While fans adored Lauren and Heidi as best friends, things quickly <a href=#>unraveled following their feud.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Hills Cast Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Although The Hills continued despite LC's falling out with Heidi, Conrad officially stepped down for good after the fifth season. The star managed to secure <a href=#>another reality show with MTV</a>, however it did not come to fruition, leaving many questions unanswered. So, what really happened between Lauren and Heidi? Let's find out!</p><p><strong>Updated on February 22, 2023: </strong>Reality stars Lauren Conrad and Heidi Montag are still avoiding each other to this day. While it is not so much a feud at this point, both women have continued so far down different paths that it seems unlikely they will ever make up and rekindle their past best-friendship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the last few years, Montag has been involved in three productions: Assassin 33 A.D. (2020), Do You Like to Party (2021), and Black Easter (2021), along with the upcoming title Senior Year: Love Never Fails. Conrad, on the other hand, has stayed out of Hollywood and instead focuses on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lifestyle brand Lauren Conrad Co.</a>, nonprofit The Little Market, and her shops LC Lauren Conrad and LC Little Co.</p><h2 id=the-end-of-lauren-conrad-amp-heidi-montag>The End Of Lauren Conrad & Heidi Montag</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/girls-of-the-hills-promo-photo.jfif><p>MTV has released a number of hit shows throughout their time on-air, from Real World, Jersey Shore, to Teen Mom. However, nothing will ever come close to the success reached by The Hills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show was first introduced to fans back in 2006 and was a spin-off of Lauren Conrad's television series Laguna Beach. Considering LC was the star of her own show this time around, it meant supporting characters were very much needed.</p><p>This led producers to bring on Lauren's bestie, Heidi Montag, and Audrina Patridge and Whitney Port as the series leads. It became evident that Lauren and Heidi were like two peas in a pod and essentially had their lives planned out for one another, however, that all changed.</p><p>During the second season, Heidi Montag began to date the "series villain," Spencer Pratt, who immediately rubbed Lauren the wrong way. While ditching your friends for a new romance is expected, it is never a great look, and Heidi wore that outfit far too many times.</p><p>This ultimately led to the beginning of the end for the two, though it turned out it was really just the tip of the iceberg. After Heidi broke the news to Lauren that she would be moving in with Spencer, Conrad made it clear that she had "chosen" Pratt, causing the two to distance themselves from one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Lauren 'LC' Conrad and Kristin Cavallari Friends?</a></span></p><p>With Lauren Conrad being the face of the show, it was only fitting for fellow gal pals Audrina and Whitney to take LC's side, much like most fans did.</p><h2 id=who-started-the-sex-tape-rumors>Who Started The Sex Tape Rumors?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/heidi-montag-and-spencer-pratt-png3.png><p>During the summer of 2007, it was revealed that<strong> </strong>Heidi and Spencer had run around town spreading rumors about Lauren, the heaviest one being that she and her former boyfriend, Jason Wahler, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">allegedly made adult tapes.</a></p><p>This was still a controversial event at the time and with Heidi remaining loyal to someone who hurt Lauren, fans were ready to give them both the cold shoulder, and boy did they ever!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Heidi accused Brody Jenner of spreading the adult tape rumors, it became clear that Spencer was the mastermind behind the plan, which was ultimately the straw that broke the camel's back. Heidi and Lauren ceased all communication between each other, both on the show and in real life.</p><p>Many fans fail to realize that despite the production value behind their feud, Heidi and Lauren were, in fact, best friends, so the events that transpired off-camera regarding the rumors was something LC could not brush under the rug.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened In The Feud Between TLC's Unexpected And MTV's Teen Mom?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-final-lauren-conrad-and-heidi-montag-moment>The Final Lauren Conrad And Heidi Montag Moment</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/The-Hills-Season-1-cast.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Heidi and Spencer began filming their scenes separate from Lauren's, which would go on to become the show's formula up until Lauren's departure in the middle of season five. Although the women are no longer on speaking terms, they have had a few heartfelt moments, including Lauren's surprise appearance at Heidi's wedding in 2008. While this gave fans a sliver of hope that the two might be able to move on and makeup, they never did.</p><p>As if that wasn't bad enough, "Speidi" continued their anti-Lauren comments throughout the remainder of their career, whether it be in interviews, on the show, or on social media, proving that Lauren not only made the right decision but got out early on. Now, both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heidi and Spencer appear on the MTV reboot</a>, The Hills: New Beginnings, which has come to show Speidi's old ways are still very much alive and well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After getting into a fight with fellow cast members Stephanie Pratt, Brody Jenner, and Whitney Port on the newest season, fans noticed that not much has changed when it comes to Spencer's temper, the same temper that led to one of the biggest reality television feuds in history.</p><h2 id=heidi-montag-dissed-lauren-conrad>Heidi Montag Dissed Lauren Conrad</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/lauren-conrad-at-the-the-little-market-s-international-women-s-day-event.jpg><p>Back in August, Heidi Montag spoke out regarding her time working alongside Lauren Conrad, revealing that she felt as if she was treated like a "dog" when it came to her and LC's feud. During her time visiting the Call Her Daddy podcast, Montag went on about her past relationship with Lauren, claiming Conrad didn't always make the right moves.</p><p>The New Beginnings star went on to compare Lauren Conrad to on-screen rival Kristin Cavallari, claiming <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LC didn't live up to her truest potential.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She is not where she should have been at all. She has a Kohl's line—great, whatever. But she should be a hundred-millionaire—are you kidding me? Who gets that big promotion, that big fame, that big engine behind her, the loved one, the this-and-that. The narrator—no one even gets the narrator show. Kylie didn't get a narrator show. She should be so rich," Heidi said.</p><p>The star went on to claim that Cavallari was "more successful," however Lauren remains $10 million richer than Kristin, and not to mention her family is still very much intact. Fans were quick to call out Heidi, claiming she is still spiteful over their feud, and we definitely agree.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2BmrculsGagkaW9prrEnWSbnaSssqa6jKWYrqqVo3qku82rmJ1lkaOxbrTEopuiZZ2ku7Wtxmg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./all-about-ty-murray-net-worth-relationship-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All About Ty Murray | Net Worth, Relationship, Career">&larr;
