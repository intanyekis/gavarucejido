Travis' last big scandal was Astroworld, but now, he's in more hot water with both fans and followers and Kylie, it seems. Experts have already spoken — and <a href=#>said Travis isn't with Kylie for the right reasons</a> — but there might be more to the story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rumors abound that Travis has been stepping out on Kylie, and a very invested fan has compiled plenty of tea on the topic.</p><h2 id=rumors-suggest-travis-scott-stepped-out-on-kylie-jenner-with-his-ex>Rumors Suggest Travis Scott Stepped Out On Kylie Jenner With His Ex</h2><p>Multiple news outlets reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Travis Scott's alleged mistress had come forward</a>. The rumor suggests that Travis had been cheating on Kylie for some time and that the mistress in question was his ex.</p><p>Rojean Kar (AKA Yung Sweet Ro on social media) posted an Instagram Story suggesting she was on the set of a music video with Scott. Ok! Magazine and other outlets reiterate the rumor that Rojean and Travis have a history extending back to 2013.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Will Travis Scott Actually Be On The Hook For The $10 Billion Astroworld Lawsuit?">Will Travis Scott Actually Be On The Hook For The $10 Billion Astroworld Lawsuit?</a></span></p><p>Travis and Kylie met around 2017, with their first child arriving in 2018. They split up in September 2019 but got back together and later welcomed their son in February 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Scott's alleged mistress seems to suggest that he has been seeing her since long before he connected with Kylie. According to her, their romance never ended.</p><h2 id=travis-scott-says-the-rumors-are-entirely-untrue-and-that-he-39-s-been-faithful-to-kylie>Travis Scott Says The Rumors Are Entirely Untrue (And That He's Been Faithful To Kylie)</h2><p>Travis Scott, for his part, is adamant that the rumors are untrue. His Instagram Story response to the rumors noted, in part, that the set he was on involved "an uninvited person" "sneaking photos."</p><p>This is referring to Rojean, whose Story didn't say whether she was invited or not.</p><p>Travis' story also noted, "I don't know this person. I've never been with this person. So please stop with the continuous cyber games and the fictional storytelling."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A friend of Travis' confirmed his story, saying, "This lady is delusional..." and "nothing else to see here."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Fans Noticed Something Weird About Kylie Jenner's Teeth">Fans Noticed Something Weird About Kylie Jenner's Teeth</a></span></p><p>The drama didn't stop there, though, with Rojean taking to TikTok to give her response to Travis' and his friends' comments.</p><p>Her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok video, which multiple people have dueted and responded to</a>, noted, in part, that she had photos of the two of them together, and that Travis cheats on Kylie "every single [expletive] night."</p><p>She also suggested that Travis and his crew pushed her to keep their connection under wraps.</p><h2 id=one-fan-took-a-deep-dive-into-travis-39-past-and-connected-him-to-the-39-ex-39>One Fan Took A Deep Dive Into Travis' Past And Connected Him To The 'Ex'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Travis continued to deny the rumors about him and Rojean, one dedicated fan took a very deep dive into both of their social media histories, travel histories, and all kinds of other details to uncover the truth — and it looks like they've got receipts.</p><p>The site <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celeb Deep Dives</a> posted a rundown of the purported relationship history between Travis Scott and Rojean Kar in December 2021, months ahead of the latter's Instagram reveal.</p><p>The first bombshell? Rojean and Travis seem to have been connected as early as 2013 when they were both in Paris within days of each other. Images on their respective Instagram accounts even seem to show each other in the background or otherwise obscured, both in Paris and other locations.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Kylie Jenner Sparks Marriage Rumors To Travis Scott As She Wears Diamond 'Wedding' Band ">Kylie Jenner Sparks Marriage Rumors To Travis Scott As She Wears Diamond 'Wedding' Band</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Celeb Deep Dives also points out that a lot of people in Travis' "crew" liked and commented on Rojean's content starting in 2013. There's also an image that commenters suggest is of Rojean and Travis, though it's pretty blurry.</p><p>The two were tracked through the years as they appeared to be off and on, and both made appearances on occasions like Drake's various holiday parties, again posting pics with the same setting and background.</p><p>Other hints that the two remained close over the years include Rojean captioning her Instagram snaps with as-yet-unreleased lyrics from Travis' albums, Rojean attending Travis' birthday party one year (which Kylie threw for him), and more location-matching pictures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Travis met Kylie, his travel history continued to align with Rojean's geo-tagged social media history, Celeb Deep Dives noted; the site also says the two appear to wear complementary "promise rings."</p><p>From 2018 forward, when Travis was with Kylie and very tied up with having a baby and whatnot, Celeb Deep Dives suggests there are hidden messages and imagery (Travis calling Rojean "bacon," images of teddy bears) between the two.</p><p>Some of Travis' lyrics are even suggested to be about Rojean, specifically phrases about him paying a woman's bills (Kylie wouldn't need that) and references to ending up in divorce court.</p><p>Many of Rojean's social media posts over the years also include captions that internet sleuths think refer to Travis and/or Kylie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-travis-hiding-something-from-the-world-that-kylie-already-knows-about>Is Travis Hiding Something From The World (That Kylie Already Knows About)?</h2><p>After all the bad press from Astroworld, it's entirely possible that Travis Scott wants to avoid making publicity waves. And whether he cheated on Kylie or not, it does seem as if all the 'receipts' suggest he does, in fact, know Rojean Kar.</p><p>What's more, the social media evidence suggests that they did date, with a final 'cutoff' date sometime around 2019. Of course, Travis may continue to shrug off the allegations, in which case, fans can only continue to watch and wait to see what might happen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqb%2BiwsisZKybn6nBbq%2FHnpitZZ%2BjeqzFy6KcZqKVo7umvo4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-cameron-diazs-hair-was-so-short-in-charlies-angels-details.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Cameron Diazs Hair Was So Short in Charlies Angels: Details">&larr;
