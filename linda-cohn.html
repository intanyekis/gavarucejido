Career in the Beginning</h2><p>When it comes to her work, Linda has always been a sports lover, starting at a young age. Linda used to spend time with her father and watch sports on television as a child. Similarly, when Linda was 15, her mother discovered a hockey league in which she could participate and demonstrate her aptitude on the rink.
