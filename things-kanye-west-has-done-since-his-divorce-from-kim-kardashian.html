It took over a year before a court declared the two legally single, though they remain engaged in negotiations over their assets.But to the surprise of few, Kanye hasn’t taken Kim’s decision to divorce well. He’s been the subject of numerous scandals and gone on regular social media tirades, many of them involving Kim, in the last two and a half years. Kanye continues to bring attention to his former relationship with Kim due to his antics. Here are 12 of the wildest things Kanye has done since she filed for divorce.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Reasons Ellen DeGeneres Is Officially Canceled</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dated-a-kim-kardashian-look-alike><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Dated A Kim Kardashian Look Alike</span></h2><p>Kanye may have had an issue when Kim began dating someone after their divorce, but he was the first one to publicly move on with a new romance. One of the first women he dated was Chaney Jones, who the media dubbed a Kim Kardashian-lookalike (and it’s not hard to see why).</p><p>Kanye has dated several other women since his break-up from Kim, including Julia Fox, Irina Shayk, and Candice Swanepoel.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Did Sylvester Stallone And Jennifer Flavin Get Back Together?</a></span></p><h2 id=vowed-to-win-his-ex-wife-back><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Vowed To Win His Ex-Wife Back</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kanye may have been seeing other women shortly after Kim filed for divorce, but that didn’t stop him from saying he was going to win her back on multiple occasions.</p><p>For example, in November 2021, he proclaimed that God wanted him and Kim together, saying, “<a href=#>I've made mistakes</a>. I've publicly done things that were not acceptable as a husband, but right now today, for whatever reason — I didn't know I was going to be in front of this mic — but I'm here to change the narrative.”</p><h2 id=bought-the-home-across-from-kim><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Bought The Home Across From Kim</span></h2><p>Kanye made headlines in December 2021 when he bought a $4.5 million home right across from Kim Kardashian’s California mansion, later saying it was so he could be as close to his kids as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=harassed-pete-davidson-into-therapy><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Harassed Pete Davidson Into Therapy</span></h2><p>When Pete Davidson began dating Kim in the fall of 2021, he became the subject of many of Kanye’s online tirades for months to come. Kanye even encouraged his fans to berate Pete if they saw him in public. It was later reported <a href=#>the comedian had entered trauma therapy</a> to process Kanye’s harassment. He and Kim have since broken up.</p><h2 id=released-a-disturbing-music-video-amp-song><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Released A Disturbing Music Video & Song</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kanye didn’t limit himself to harassing Pete on social media. He went so far to release a song, “Eazy,” where he raps that God saved him from his 2005 car crash just so he can “beat” up Pete. Moreover, the animated music video for the song <a href=#>showed Kanye burying a likeness of Pete alive</a>.</p><h2 id=said-his-children-have-been-kidnapped><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Said His Children Have Been Kidnapped</span></h2><p>Kanye has made various allegations on social media, many of which center around co-parenting his four kids with Kim. On several occasions, the rapper has claimed his ex-wife kidnapped their youngest daughter, Chicago, on her fourth birthday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“<a href=#>YALL BASICALLY KIDNAPPED</a> CHICAGO ON HER BIRTHDAY SO SHE COULD REMEMBER HER FATHER NOT BEING THERE,” Kanye wrote in an October 2022 Instagram post. He continued, “YALL ALSO THREW A PARTY BEFORE PSALMS BIRTHDAY WHEN I WAS FLYING BACK FROM JAPAN TO BE THERE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY AND THE FIRST I HEARD ABOUT IT WAS SEEING PICS OF THE PARTY ON LINE.”</p><h2 id=said-kris-jenner-will-exploit-his-daughters><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Said Kris Jenner Will Exploit His Daughters</span></h2><p>Kanye doesn’t limit his parenting criticisms to Kim. He’s also called out his former mother-in-law, Kris Jenner. In September 2022, he said he needed to protect his daughters from the momager’s corruptive ways.</p><p>“<a href=#>Don’t let Kris make you do</a>Playboy like she made Kylie and Kim do,” he said on IG. “Hollywood is a giant brothel. Pornography destroyed my family. I deal with the addiction [and] Instagram promotes it. Not gonna let it happen to Northy and Chicago.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Leonardo DiCaprio And Gigi Hadid’s Relationship A PR Stunt?</a></span></p><h2 id=called-black-lives-matter-a-scam><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Called Black Lives Matter A Scam</span></h2><p>Kanye has pretty recently begun promoting some far-right beliefs. He was a staunch supporter of former U.S. President Donald Trump during his elections. Kanye has gone so far as to call the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement a “scam.”</p><h2 id=wore-a-ldquo-white-lives-matter-rdquo-shirt><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Wore A “White Lives Matter” Shirt</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The rapper dissed the Black Lives Matter movement even further when he showed up to a Yeezy fashion show in Paris wearing a “White Lives Matter” shirt in October 2022. Several of the show’s models also wore the shirt on the runway. Kanye later defended the controversial shirt, saying, “<a href=#>I thought the shirt was a funny shirt</a>. I thought the idea of wearing it was funny. And I said, ‘Dad, why do you think it’s funny?’ And he said, ‘Just a black man stating the obvious.”</p><h2 id=likely-lost-his-partnership-with-adidas><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Likely Lost His Partnership With Adidas</span></h2><p>Kanye received a ton of backlash for his comments on BLM as well as the “White Lives Matter” shirt. Shortly after, Adidas announced it was <a href=#>reconsidering their partnership with Ye</a>. The rapper has been vocally unhappy about their partnership (even calling one of their shoe collabs poor quality), so it’s not a surprising move.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ended-his-collaboration-with-the-gap><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ended His Collaboration With The Gap</span></h2><p>Another clothing collaboration that came to an end for Kanye post-divorce was his relationship with The Gap. After vocalizing his dissatisfaction online, Kanye decided to end their professional collaboration. He shared a notice of termination on his Instagram, which said “<a href=#>Gap has abandoned its contractual obligations</a>.”</p><h2 id=has-called-everyone-out-online><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Has Called Everyone Out Online</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, there’s a growing number of people who’ve been mentioned by Kanye in his online rants since his split from Kim. He’s called out most of the Kardashian-Jenners, including Khloe in October 2022, after she left a comment on one of his posts asking him to stop harassing Kim.</p><p>But Kanye has also called out other celebrities like Gigi Hadid (<a href=#>who he says is a “privileged Karen”),</a> Rick Ross, Drake, the late Virgil Abloh, Mark Zuckerberg, Vogue editor Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, and he doesn’t seem to be slowing down.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGenMBut8CnsJ5lp5rAtXnHmqpmnJ%2Bjsm6%2FyKeanmWYnsBusMivpqublWKzs7vMZqKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./aaron-rodgers-back-medically-cleared.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aaron Rodgers may be medically cleared next week to return to play: Reports">&larr;
