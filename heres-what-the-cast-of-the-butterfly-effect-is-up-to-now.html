Since the movie premiered, its star-studded cast members have ventured into other things and elevated their respective careers to the next level. From <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashton Kutcher</a> to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Logan Lerman</a>, here's what the cast of The Butterfly Effect have been up to today.</p><h2 id=irene-gorovaia><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Irene Gorovaia</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Irene-Gorovaia.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Russia-born actress Irene Gorovaia takes on Kayleigh's role at 13. During production of&nbsp;The Butterfly Effect, Gorovaia had just kicked off her acting career in Hollywood after years of making noise with theater and ballet. In the past few years, she's been busy scoring wins at film festivals, including a win at The Endless Mountain Film Festival as the Best Supporting Actress in After the Outbreak and a nomination for Best Actress at The Nice International Film Festival in France in 2017.</p><h2 id=john-patrick-amedori><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>John Patrick Amedori</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Evan-13.jpg><p>Playing Evans at 13, John Patrick Amedori is best known for playing Gabe Mitchell in the 2014 dark comedy Dear White People. He's been reprising his role in the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a></strong> adaptation of the movie since 2017. He stars as the main hero's love interest, sharing the stage with the likes of Logan Browning, Brandon Bell, Marque Richardson, Giancarlo Esposito, and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=logan-lerman><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Logan Lerman</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Logan-Lerman.jpg><p>Undoubtedly one of the best alum of the movie, Logan Lerman somewhat became a teen idol in the 2010s. He played the title role in the Percy Jackson franchise. After years of keeping himself busy with movies, he made his comeback to television with Amazon Prime's series Hunters last year. Now, he's set to serve as one of the executive producers for the upcoming Rothko, alongside his long-time collaborator, Jonathan Schwartz.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Let's Explore Logan Lerman's Career: From 'Perks Of Being A Wallflower' To 'Hunters'</a></span></p><h2 id=ethan-suplee><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ethan Suplee</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Ethan-Suplee.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who could ever forget Thumper, Evan's roommate who saves him in several scenarios? It was Ethan Suplee who brought the character to life. However, you may not recognize the actor should you ever accidentally bump into him on the street. Back in 2011, TMZ on TV reported Suplee's amazing weight loss of over 200 pounds. At one point, he even reached an all-time low of 9 percent body fat. Recently, he secured three cameo episodes in Good Girls and ventured into voice-acting in Disney Jr.'s&nbsp; Vampirina.</p><h2 id=elden-henson><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Elden Henson</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Elden.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elden Henson starred as the adult version of Evan's friend Lenny. Before the movie premiered, Henson was already a rising star best known for playing Fulton Reed in The Mighty Ducks in the '90s. After that, he continued filling his acting CV with more impressive titles, including Marvel's Daredevil and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 and Part 2. He even reprised his Mighty Ducks role in the 2021 reboot of the comedy drama for Disney+.</p><h2 id=callum-keith-rennie><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Callum Keith Rennie</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Callum-Keith-Rennie.jpg><p>Callum Rennie's portrayal of such an evil father to Evan was so good that many hated the actor after the movie was released. He's a "victim" of typecasting, meaning that he is frequently cast as a bad guy in movies and series. A proud Canadian at heart, Rennie is also an avid golfer and hockey player. His last top-dollar role was as Detective Halloran in Jigsaw in 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=william-lee-scott><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>William Lee Scott</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/William-Lee-Scott.jpg><p>William Scott had such a promising career back in the early 2000s. His brilliant portrayal in The Butterfly Effect as Kayleigh's estranged brother made many wonder how big his career could be. Unfortunately, that's not the case, as the actor has been enjoying quite some time away from Hollywood. However, his last two roles in Stoker Hills and TheNeighborhood happened in 2021, so here's hoping for more.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Movie Scenes Where Actors Were Actually Terrified</a></span></p><h2 id=eric-stoltz><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Eric Stoltz</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Eric-Stoltz.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before The Butterfly Effect, Eric Stoltz was a well-renowned name.
