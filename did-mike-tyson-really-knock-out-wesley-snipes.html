While he had his controversies, the man is a legend who is now in the podcast sphere. He has also made a mark in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">professional wrestling</a> and has earned a big enough legacy that he will be having <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his own biopic</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tyson is known for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">using his hands</a> better than almost everyone else in the world, and there are few people crazy enough to mess with him. Allegedly, an incident took place between Mike Tyson and Wesley Snipes back in the day, and the story is wilder than you’d think!</p><p>Let’s take a look at the alleged incident between Tyson and Snipes!</p><h2 id=the-situation-at-hand>The Situation At Hand</h2><p>In order to get a true understanding and appreciation for everything going on in the story, it is important to note that this firsthand account comes from Mike Tyson’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">former bodyguard</a> in his book titled The Inner Ring.</p><p>According to the, book Mike Tyson rolled up to a spot where Wesley Snipes was at with&nbsp;a woman by the name of Hope that Tyson was seeing. Turns out, Snipes was getting a little too friendly with Hope. As soon as it was discovered that Tyson was rolling up to the scene, she quickly fled to try and get away while Tyson made his&nbsp;entrance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, Wesley Snipes does have a legitimate martial arts background, but the fact that he even considered crossing paths with Mike Tyson is completely insane. Sure, Wesley Snipes can do some cool stunts in&nbsp;movies, but Mike Tyson is a former heavyweight boxing champion who was able to take down some of the best boxers of his era.</p><p>Once Tyson made his way inside the building, things would quickly take a dramatic turn, and we have to wonder what in the world was going on in Wesley Snipes’ mind when the former champion made his presence felt.</p><p>According to an excerpt from the book, “When Hope caught sight of him, she practically fell out of Snipes’ lap and onto the floor. The actor froze then waved a hand. ‘Now, Mike, now, Mike, we can do this together. I don’t want no problem.”</p><p>Unfortunately for Wesley Snipes, things would not get much better after this particular moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Tyson Could Have Been Worth $685 Million, But Here’s What He’s Left With</a></span></p><h2 id=tyson-handles-his-business>Tyson Handles His Business</h2><p>Now that Mike Tyson had officially tracked down Wesley Snipes and Hope, it was time for him to go and handle his business in the only way that he knew how.</p><p>Any person that has ever watched clips of Mike Tyson know that he wasn’t exactly the most stable person back during his fighting days, and we shudder to think how angry he was when he discovered what was going on between Wesley and Hope.</p><p>According to his former bodyguard, “When I returned from the parking lot, I noticed Anthony was blocking the bathroom door. A couple minutes later we heard a big noise inside, and then Tyson emerged alone.&nbsp;After he was gone, I cracked open the bathroom door. Wesley Snipes was sitting against the far wall, head tilted to one side, unconscious.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yes, things allegedly got so ugly between the two of them that Mike Tyson took Wesley Snipes into a bathroom and completely <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">flattened him out</a>. To be fair, Wesley Snipes didn’t understand&nbsp;who he was crossing, and clearly, Mike Tyson had little interest in talking things out that particular day.</p><p>Over the years both men have had something to say about this particular incident, and it should come as no surprise that Wesley Snipes has been rather defensive about everything that took place.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Tyson Says Jamie Foxx Might Join His New Fighting League And Fight Comedians</a></span></p><h2 id=the-fallout-of-it-all>The Fallout Of It All</h2><p>Stories that emerge about celebrities who wind getting physical&nbsp;are pretty few and far between, so when it does get reported that someone gets completely beat up in a bathroom, the person on the receiving end of the beating&nbsp;is usually going to be quick to deny the story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wesley Snipes word eventually goes on record denying that anything took place between him and Mike Tyson, and we have to imagine that this comes from a place of hurt. Getting beat up and then having the entire world find out has got to be a stinging feeling.</p><p>Interestingly, Tyson would corroborate Snipes’ account. In his book, Tyson would say that he confronted Snipes, and Snipes said, “Mike, please don’t hit me in my face, that’s how I make a living.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Fans Think Wesley Snipes Is A Diva</a></span></p><p>So, did Tyson actually knock him out? Well, it’s entirely possible that Tyson is just helping Snipes save face. Either that or his former security guard was just making up some nonsense.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Tyson Tells Joe Rogan “It’s Not Funny,” After He Laughs At Tyson’s Pain-Filled Story</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdorassYytsKynnmK%2Fpq3LpbBmo56ksKx5zq6rZq%2BVqLmmxYyspaKolah8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./neal-skupski-wife-cambri-prevost-everything-on-their-wedding-and-age-difference.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Everything On Their Wedding And Age Difference The Talks Today">&larr;
