Law” (1989).</p><p>In 1990, Kathy landed the role that would change her life: obsessed fan Annie Wilkes in “Misery.” She earned critical acclaim and an Oscar and Golden Globe for her performance, and Wilkes was ranked #17 on the American Film Institute’s “100 Heroes and Villains” list. Bates would star in another Stephen King film, “Dolores Claiborne,” in 1995. In 1991, she played Evelyn Couch in “Fried Green Tomatoes” and earned a Golden Globe nomination, and she was nominated for her first Primetime Emmy in 1996, for her portrayal of Helen Kushnick (Jay Leno’s manager) in the HBO film “The Late Shift.” In 1997, Kathy played Molly Brown in “Titanic,” one of the most commercially successful films of all time with a worldwide gross of $2.195 billion. She earned another Academy Award nomination for the 1998 political film “Primary Colors” and received Emmy nominations for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for “3rd Rock from the Sun” and Outstanding Directing in a Miniseries or Movie for “Dash & Lilly” in 1999.

In 2003, Bates was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, but it was not public knowledge until January 2009 when she stated that she had been “in total remission” for more than five years. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in July 2012 and underwent a double mastectomy. Two years later at the New York Walk for Lymphedema & Lymphatic Diseases, Kathy revealed (in a pre-recorded message) that she has lymphedema in her arms as a result of the double mastectomy, and she began serving on the Lymphatic Education & Research Network’s honorary board as a chairperson later that year. Bates also became a spokesperson for lymphedema, and in 2018, she took part in Capitol Hill Lobby Day in an attempt to get more research funding for the condition and spoke at the DC/VA Walk to Fight Lymphedema & Lymphatic Diseases. She was honored with a 2018 WebMD Health Heroes “Game Changer” Award for her dedication to raising awareness of lymphedema.</p><p><strong>Awards and Nominations:</strong> Bates won an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for “Misery” in 1991, and she was also nominated for “Primary Colors,” “About Schmidt,” and “Richard Jewell.” She has been nominated for eight Golden Globes, winning Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for “Misery” in 1991 and Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television for “The Late Shift” in 1997.
