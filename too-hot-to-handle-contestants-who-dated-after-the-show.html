However, Lana had something else in store for them - A smooch, self-gratification and sex ban!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Exclusive: How Too Hot to Handle Shaped Jaz Holloway's Dating Life</a></span></p><p>After three seasons and Lana's rigorous workshops, meditation and bonding exercises, these horny singles who have had meaningless sex all their lives are transformed into forming meaningful connections, and sometimes finding love that goes beyond the villa. They have also found fame after the show, with <a href=#>massive success and mouth-watering net worths,</a> a decent following on social media, and a whole new life in the public sphere. So here's a look at the Too Hot to Handle alums who dated during the show, and continued their romance outside the villa, as well as some who got together after the show wrapped.</p><h2 id=rhonda-paul-and-sharron-townsend><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Rhonda Paul And Sharron Townsend</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sharron-and-rhonda.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The hot mom and model connected with Sharron on deep emotional levels, with the pair already discussing plans outside the villa. Unfortunately, their relationship didn't make it in the real world.</p><p>Back in April 2020, Rhonda revealed during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Women's Health</a> that the two were no longer together due to the distance, and that they have not even had the time to meet physically since the show. However, they remained friends.</p><h2 id=joey-joy-and-carla-lawrence><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Joey Joy And Carla Lawrence</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/carly-and-joey.jpg><p>The two began their romance after Carly had broken it off with Chase DeMoor in season 2. This new romance was a breath of fresh air for Carly. They couple briefly broke up after filming wrapped, but rekindled their romance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After moving in together, and getting matching tattoos, they split for the second time.

What seemed like more of a physical connection and sexual tension which removed them from the show turned out to be a big deal - at least for a while.</p><p>However, the two broke up late last year after celebrating 8 months together in August 2021. Robert spoke about the breakup in September that same year on his Instagram, and told MailOnline that it was a mutual decision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicole-o-39-brien-and-bryce-hirschberg><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Nicole O'Brien And Bryce Hirschberg</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/nicole-and-bryce.jpg><p>During the show, this pair never dated or gave viewers any incline of a potential romance, just friendship. They got together after season 1 wrapped, and went public with their relationship in April 2020.</p><p>Unfortunately, they called it off the following month due to the distance. They even appeared on MTV's Ex on the Beach early this year, with Nicole wanting to get her man back, but the close pair decided to only remain friends.</p><h2 id=beaux-raymond-and-harry-johnson><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Beaux Raymond And Harry Johnson</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/283047.jfif> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starting off on a non-romantic connection, at least for Harry, the two had one of the sweetest, genuine, and goofiest romance on the show. When they emerged winners of season 3, viewers agreed it was the right choice for this fan-favorite.</p><p>The couple posted loved up pictures during the time the show aired in January but <a href=#>they split after returning from the villa</a>. They confirmed their breakup during the show's reunion, but mentioned they still remain friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Does The ‘Too Hot To Handle’ Cast Make Per Episode?</a></span></p><h2 id=nathan-soan-and-holly-scarfone><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Nathan Soan And Holly Scarfone</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/holly-nathan-too-hot-s3-5-1642695393671.jpg><p>These two couldn't keep their hands to themselves in season 3, making their time on the villa the most expensive loss by a couple across all seasons, costing their cast mates a whooping $90,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The young couple appears to have grown during the show, and even though they weren't crowned winners, their profound growth made their time all worth it.

As the season progressed, the couple's attraction for each other blossomed into something more than just looks. They began dating on the show, and it seemed things were going to work out for the two notwithstanding the distance. They split, then later reconciled, with the two even getting engaged.
