One of the lucky contestants, Brayden Bowers, will get a k**s on the first day. The travel nurse will be criticized by other suitors for boasting about k**sing Charity.</strong></p><p>One of the suitors, Sean, confessed, saying:</p><p><strong>“Nice work,” I think. Even though you got a k**s, you told everyone. I think it’s disrespectful to the other men. Get the f**k out of here.</strong></p><p>Travel nurse Brayden Bowers, 24, works in San Diego, California. If the first k**s between him and Charity will win him the season’s first impression rose, only time will tell.</p><h2>For the US Army, Brayden Bowers holds a license as a practical nurse</h2><p>On season 20 of The Bachelorette, Brayden Bowers will be one of Charity Lawson’s suitors. He started working for the US Army in May 2017 as a licensed practical nurse, according to his LinkedIn profile. He earned a biology degree from Palomar College, it continued. In-depth information about Brayden is provided in his ABC bio, which describes him as “hardworking and romantic” and “funny as he is handsome.”</p><p>The traveling nurse says a marriage is the one thing that’s seriously missing from his life even if he has big hopes for the future. The article continues, “Brayden has been in committed relationships before, but is thrilled about this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to date Charity.</p><p>The bio goes on to say:</p><p><strong>Brayden is “willing to risk everything to find his perfect match when he is in love, and he loves that love fiercely.” Brayden hopes that his future wife will be trustworthy, adventurous, and most of all, will adore River the dog just as much as he does! Could Charity be the person River and Brayden have been looking for?</strong></p><p>Three fascinating facts about him are also included. The advertisement claims that Brayden is looking for someone who can teach him how to salsa dance rather than a contemplative man who enjoys a “good cigar lounge.”</p><p>He is preparing to seduce Charity Lawson on season 20 of The Bachelorette in the interim. She inquired about Braydon’s feelings during their first one-on-one in a sneak peek video.</p><p><strong>“I’m amazing. I’m right here at your side.I was thrilled when I heard out you were the Bachelorette,” he informed Charity.</strong></p><p>As the two enjoyed their first k**s, jealous and offended potential suitors watched. When Brayden started bragging about the k**s to his rivals, they became upset. In his words, he was “ready for that first impression rose.”</p><h2>On June 26, The Bachelorette’s 20th season will premiere</h2><p>The Bachelorette season 20 will also feature appearances from Brayden Bowers, Aaron Bryant, Aaron Schwartzman, Adrian, Caleb A., James, Joe, Caleb B., Christopher, Dotun, Joseph “Joey,” John., Josh, Kaleb K., Michael, John Henry, Nicholas Peter, Sean, Spencer, Tanner, Taylor, Warwick, Xavier, and Ahmad Khalid. On Monday, June 26, 2023, at 9 p.m. ET, ABC will broadcast the premiere episode of the new season.</p><p>The official summary of the episode reads as follows:</p><p><strong>“The search for love by charity begins!” A total of 25 hot guys show up, hoping to impress her and win her heart. Later, at the cocktail party, Charity’s brother Nehemiah drops a shocking bombshell, which causes the evening to take an unexpected turn. Every second counts when making a good first impression, so the pressure is on.</strong></p><p>The following day, the episode will also be accessible on Hulu. Every Monday, a brand-new episode of The Bachelorette season 20 will air on ABC.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":301184,"10":2,"14":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"15":"Arial","18":1,"21":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/"}{"1":78}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>former contestant on The Bachelor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Who Is Loewy Malkovich?
