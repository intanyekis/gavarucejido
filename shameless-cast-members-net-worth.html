The nation has fallen in love with the troubled Gallagher family as they struggle to make ends meet in&nbsp;the South Side of Chicago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Net Worth Of The Cast Of Parks And Recreation</a></span></p><p>Now ten seasons in (and holding the title of&nbsp;longest-running scripted series&nbsp;on the Showtime network,) Shameless has won over the viewing public with the trials and tribulations of characters that feel like real people. Here are the estimated net worth of each main cast member of the show.</p><h2 id=shanola-hampton---1-million>Shanola Hampton - $1 million</h2><p>Shanola Hampton is a fan favorite as she portrays the sassy and loyal&nbsp;best friend Veronica Fisher a.k.a. "V." Shanola worked hard to get to where she is today, earning an undergraduate degree in Theatre from Winthrop University and then a Master of Fine Arts in acting from the University of Illinois.</p><p>While Shameless is considered her breakout role, fans might also recognize her from the film Things Never Said. She also made appearances in the shows&nbsp;Reba, Popular, Scrubs, <a href=#>Criminal Minds</a>, Related, and Miami Medical. Her estimated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> is&nbsp;$1 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ethan-cutkosky---1-million>Ethan Cutkosky - $1 million</h2><p>Ethan Cutkosky got the role of the mischievous Carl Gallagher when he was just a little kid. Now 20 years old, viewers got to watch Ethan grow up alongside his character.</p><p>His first movie role was in the 2007 movie Fred Claus, but the industry really took notice of Ethan after he starred in the 2009 film The Unborn with Gary Oldman. He also starred in the 2010 movie Conviction before landing his role on Shameless, which he still stars on to this day. His rumored <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> is $1 million.</p><h2 id=christian-isaiah---1-5-million>Christian Isaiah - $1.5 million</h2><p>When Shameless first began, the character of Liam Gallagher was just a baby. Now ten seasons in, Liam has grown and is getting plots of his own. Christian Isaish currently plays the older Liam, and was said to love the spotlight since he was a mere infant. Christian performed in school plays before being invited to the International Presentation of Performers in Los Angeles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Net Worth Of Every Main Character From American Horror Story</a></span></p><p>He's made appearances in the shows Married, Teachers, Reel Kids and Jimmy Kimmel Live, but Shameless is his first main role.

His rumored <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> is $1.5 million.</p><h2 id=steve-howey---2-million>Steve Howey - $2 million</h2><p>Steve Howey started his acting career with guest spots on popular shows like ER, The Drew Carey Show, and The X-Files. He got his big break when he was cast as the dopey-yet-charming Van on the sitcom Reba.</p><p>He starred on Reba for six years before taking movie roles in films like Supercross, DOA: Dead or Alive, Bride Wars, Something Borrowed, and Stan Helsing. Now, he's best recognized as the dopey-yet-charming (a type he apparently plays very well!) Kevin a.k.a "Kev" on Shameless. His rumored <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> is $2 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cameron-monaghan---2-million>Cameron Monaghan - $2 million</h2><p>Cameron Monaghan began his career as a child actor, appearing in a television adaptation of <i>The Music Man</i>. He then snagged recurring roles on Malcolm in the Middle and Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide and did guest spots on shows like Criminal Minds, The Mentalist, Numbers, Monk, and countless more.</p><p>While his role as the troubled Ian Gallagher on Shameless has gained him the most attention, he's also recognized for his roles as twins Jerome and Jerimiah Valeska on <a href=#>the show Gotham</a>. He also had roles in films like The Giver and Vampire Academy. His estimated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> is $2 million.</p><h2 id=noel-fisher---3-million>Noel Fisher - $3 million</h2><p>Noel Fisher, who plays bad boy Mickey Milkovich, has a bit of an eclectic career. He's appeared in movies like Max Keeble's Big Move, Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 2, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. He also has experience being a part of an ensemble cast starring in the television shows Godiva's and The Riches, both of which ran for two seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After starring on Shameless for years, Noel took a break to do other projects like the miniseries The Long Road Home, the miniseries The Red Line, and the Hulu show Castle Rock. Now that Shameless is on Season 10, Noel has rejoined the show, much to many fans' delight! His estimated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> is $3 million.</p><h2 id=emma-kenney---4-million>&nbsp;Emma Kenney - $4 million</h2><p>Just like Ethan, Emma Kenney landed the role of sweetheart Debbie Gallagher when she was just a child. As she aged, her character Debbie also began to grow, maturing into a much more rebellious character than the sweetheart she&nbsp;used to be.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Cast Member of Roseanne's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Emma has done such a good job playing a rebel that she was cast as the equally rebellious teenager Harris Conner Healy on the Roseanne reboot and subsequent spin-off The Conners. She currently&nbsp;stars on both The Conners and Shameless at the same time. Her estimated<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> net worth</a> is $4 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jeremy-allen-white---8-million>&nbsp;Jeremy Allen White - $8 million</h2><p>Jeremy Allen White has always loved performing, having been raised by actor parents and studying dance throughout his childhood. Right after graduating high school, Jeremy booked the role of eldest Gallagher sibling Phillip a.k.a "Lip" on Shameless.</p><p>Aside from Shameless, Jeremy has appeared in movies like Beautiful Ohio, The Speed of Life, Afterschool, Twelve, You Can't Win, Rob the Mob, and After Everything. As for his personal life, he is married to fellow actor Addison Timlin, who just gave birth to their first child! His rumored <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> is $8 million.</p><h2 id=emmy-rossum---12-million>Emmy Rossum - $12 million</h2><p>Emmy Rossum played eldest Gallagher sibling Fiona, who was arguably the main character until Emmy chose to take a break from the show for Season 10. Emmy appeared in movies like Mystic River and The Day After Tomorrow before scoring the role of Christine in the movie-musical The Phantom of the Opera. Having studied singing and opera extensively, Emmy was certainly prepared for the role!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She has since released an album of original songs, an album of covers, and a Christmas song EP. Her performance as Fiona in Shameless touched hearts everywhere, and she shocked the world when she announced her departure from the show! Her estimated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth </a>is $12 million.</p><h2 id=william-h-macy---45-million>William H. Macy - $45 million</h2><p>William H.

He starred in various independent films before booking the starring role in the film Fargo, for which his performance earned him an Academy Award nomination.</p><p>William has starred in numerous films since, like Wild Hogs, The Maiden Heist, Dirty Girl, and The Sessions. He's also tried his hand at directing, having helmed the films Rudderless and The Layover.
